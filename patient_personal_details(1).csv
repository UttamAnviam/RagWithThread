"Patient. Good morning, doctor. I've been having some issues with my back lately, and it's starting to interfere with my daily activities. I was hoping you could help me figure out what's going on. Doctor. Good morning. I'm sorry to hear you've been dealing with back pain. Let's start by discussing your symptoms in more detail. When did the pain begin, and can you describe what it feels like? Patient. The pain started about three weeks ago. It began as a dull ache in my lower back, but over the past week, it's become sharper and more intense, especially when I bend over or lift something heavy. It's mostly in my lower back, but sometimes I feel it shooting down my left leg. Doctor. It sounds like you're experiencing sciatica, which is pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, typically starting in the lower back and traveling down the leg. Sciatica is often caused by a herniated disc or a bone spur compressing the nerve. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your leg? Patient. Yes, I have. Sometimes my leg feels tingly, and I've noticed that it's weaker than usual, especially when I'm trying to stand up from a sitting position. It's really affecting my ability to move around. Doctor. That's definitely concerning. Sciatica can be quite painful and debilitating. Let's talk about any activities or incidents that might have triggered this pain. Did you lift something heavy or twist your back awkwardly before the pain started? Patient. I think it might have started after I helped a friend move some furniture. I didn't feel anything at the time, but the next day, my back was really sore. I thought it would go away with rest, but it's just gotten worse. Doctor. Lifting heavy objects, especially without proper form, can put a lot of strain on the lower back and lead to injuries like muscle strains, herniated discs, or even ligament damage. It's possible that lifting the furniture caused a disc in your lower back to herniate or bulge, which could be pressing on your sciatic nerve. Patient. I was afraid of that. What kind of tests or exams do I need to determine if it's a herniated disc? Doctor. We'll start with a physical examination to assess your range of motion, strength, and reflexes. I'll also check for any signs of nerve compression, such as numbness or tingling in your leg. If we suspect a herniated disc or another structural issue, I may recommend imaging tests like an MRI, which provides a detailed view of the soft tissues in your back, including the discs and nerves. Patient. That makes sense. What kind of treatment options are available if it turns out to be a herniated disc? Doctor. Treatment for a herniated disc often starts with conservative measures. These can include physical therapy. A physical therapist can guide you through exercises to strengthen the muscles around your spine, improve flexibility, and reduce pressure on the affected nerve. This can help alleviate pain and prevent further injury. Medications over the counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce pain and inflammation. In some cases, muscle relaxants or prescription pain medications may be necessary. Hot and cold therapy. Applying ice to the affected area can help reduce inflammation in the first 48 hours, followed by heat therapy to relax the muscles and improve blood flow. Lifestyle modifications. It's important to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain, such as heavy lifting or prolonged sitting. Maintaining good posture, using ergonomic furniture, and practicing proper body mechanics can also help. Epidural steroid. Injections. If your pain is severe and not improving with other treatments, an epidural steroid injection can reduce inflammation and provide relief. This involves injecting a corticosteroid directly into the area around the nerve. Surgery. Surgery is usually considered a last resort when conservative treatments have failed to relieve symptoms and there's significant nerve compression causing pain, weakness, or loss of function. Procedures like a microdiscectomy, where the herniated portion of the disc is removed, can be very effective. Patient. I'd like to avoid surgery if possible. How long do you think it might take to feel better with physical therapy and other conservative treatments? Doctor. Most people with a herniated disc start to feel better within a few weeks to a few months with conservative treatments. It's important to be patient and consistent with your physical therapy exercises and to make the necessary lifestyle adjustments. Avoiding activities that strain your back and focusing on strengthening your core muscles can make a big difference. Patient. I'll do whatever it takes. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again? Doctor. Preventing future back problems involves a combination of strengthening exercises, proper body mechanics, and lifestyle changes. Here are some tips. Strengthen your core. A strong core helps support your spine and reduces the risk of injury. Exercises like planks, bridges, and pelvic tilts can be very beneficial. Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight, especially around the abdomen, puts extra strain on your lower back. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise can help reduce this strain. Practice good posture. Whether you're sitting, standing, or lifting, maintaining proper posture is key to protecting your back. Keep your back straight, shoulders back, and avoid slouching. Use proper lifting techniques. When lifting heavy objects, bend at the knees, not at the waist. Keep the object close to your body and use your leg muscles to lift rather than your back. Stay active. Regular physical activity helps keep your back muscles flexible and strong. Low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or cycling are great for maintaining overall back health. Ergonomics. Make sure your work environment is ergonomically friendly. Use a chair that supports your lower back. Keep your computer monitor at eye level, and take breaks to stretch if you're sitting for long periods. Patient. Those are great tips. I'll definitely work on incorporating them into my daily routine. Should I follow up with you after starting treatment? Doctor. Yes, I'd like to see you in about four to six weeks to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. If you're not seeing improvement or if your symptoms worsen, we may need to consider additional treatments or refer you to a specialist. In the meantime, if you have any concerns or if your pain becomes unmanageable, don't hesitate to contact me. Patient. I appreciate that. Doctor. I feel more confident about managing this now. I'll start with the physical therapy and the other recommendations you've made. Doctor. I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it's important to be consistent with your exercises and mindful of your body mechanics. With time and effort, most people with back problems see significant improvement. We'll work together to get you back to feeling your best. Patient. Thank you, doctor. I'll see you in a few weeks. Doctor. You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you soon.";"2024-09-30 12:40:37";"138";"212"

"Good morning Alex, it's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last visit? Hi Dr. Martinez, I have been okay. I guess some days are really tough. I appreciate your honesty. It's normal to have ups and downs. Can you tell me about one of your tougher days? What made it difficult? Well, there was a day last week I could not stop hearing the voices. They were really loud and I felt like I was losing control. I'm sorry to hear that Alex. I must have been overwhelming. When the voices are loud, how do they affect you? They say things like I'm worthless and nobody cares about me. It's hard to ignore them. That sounds really painful. How do you usually cope when they become overwhelming? I try to distract myself, listen to music or watch TV but sometimes it doesn't work. It's good that you are finding ways to distract yourself. Have you noticed any specific trigger that makes the voices worse for you? Yeah, stress definitely makes it worse. Like when I go to family gatherings or when work gets busy. Family gatherings can be particularly challenging. How do you feel about attending those events? I love my family but I also feel anxious around them. They don't really understand what I'm going through and I don't want to scare them. It's understandable to feel that way. It can be difficult to share your experience especially when others may not fully grasp the complexity of schizophrenia. Can you share how your family typically reacts when you try to discuss your condition? They mean well but they often say things like just think positive or you will get over it. It feels dismissive. That must be frustrating for you. You deserve to be heard and understood. If you are comfortable, would you mind sharing a little more about your experience with the voices? What do they say and how often do you hear them? They can be pretty persistent especially when I'm alone. It varies but I hear them almost daily. Sometimes they talk about things from my past, bringing up mistakes I made. That sounds distressing. Revisiting past mistakes can be particularly hard. Are there specific memories that come up frequently? Yeah, like when I drop out of college I always feel I fail everyone including myself. Dropping out can weigh heavy on your mind. It's common to have regrets but I want you to know that your family is there for you. I want you to know that your worth is not defined by your academic achievements. Have you discussed your feelings about your college with anyone? Not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my issues. You are not a burden Alex. It's okay to share your feelings. Sometimes talking about these experiences can help lighten the load. Speaking of support, do you have friends or someone you trust who you can talk to? I have a couple of friends but I have been isolating myself lately. I feel embarrassed about the voices and I don't want to explain it to them. Isolation can be tough. It's natural to feel embarrassed but true friends will want to support you through difficult times. Would you be open to the idea of discussing your experiences with them? Maybe it's just hard to find the right words. It's understandable. Sometimes it helps to prepare what you want to say beforehand. You might find that your friends can provide a lot of support and understanding changing topics a bit. How have you been managing your medication? I have been taking it but I forgot sometimes, especially on days when I am feeling really down. Consistency is important for your treatment. Have you thought about using reminders like setting alarms on your phone and keeping a medication log? I could try that. I just get so caught up in everything that I forget. That's a great plan. It might help you feel more in control. Can I ask you more about your current living situation? How is it going for you? It's okay. I guess I live alone and sometimes feel lonely other times. I like the quiet. Living alone can have its pros and cons. When you are feeling isolated, do you have any strategies to reach out to others? Not really. I mostly just stay in my apartment. It feels safer that way. Safety is important but too much isolation can contribute to feeling worse perhaps. You can explore some small steps for you to connect with others even if it's just a text or a phone call. That might be good. I just need to work up the courage. It's okay to take small steps at your own pace. Every little effort counts. Also, have you been able to engage in any hobbies or activities that you enjoy? I used to love drawing but I have not done it much lately. When I am feeling low, it's hard to pick up a pencil. Art can be a wonderful outlet for expressing your feelings. Would you consider setting aside a little time each week to draw even if just for a few minutes? That might help. I used to feel so relaxed when I draw. That's great to hear. Finding activities can bring you joy and can really help with managing symptoms. Before we wrap up, I want to revisit something we discussed earlier. Have you felt about scheduling next appointment? It's important to keep up our work together. I would like that it helps to talk things through with you. I am glad you feel that way, Alex. Remember, you are not alone with this. We are in this together and I am here to support you every step of the way. Thank you, Dr. Martinez. That means a lot to me. Thank you.";"2024-09-30 12:14:47";"139";"T67090"
"Good morning Jamie, it's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last appointment? Honestly not great, I have been feeling really low. Some days are worse than others. I'm sorry to hear that. It's okay to have ups and downs but can you tell me more about what you have been experiencing lately? I feel tired all the time. I'm dragging myself throughout the day and my thoughts just won't go away. I'm dealing with depression and in the past few days I also tried to kill myself by hanging through a ceiling fan. I'm sorry to hear that. You mentioned your thoughts that are troubling. Can you share more about those? I had these suicidal thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore. I know I have been through this before and I tried. I appreciate you being so open about this. It's important to talk about these suicidal thoughts and these mental feelings you are dealing with. How often are you experiencing these thoughts now compared to before? It's still pretty frequent. Some days I feel I'm fighting myself just to stay alive. But I keep thinking about killing myself because I'm too depressed of my life. That sounds incredibly overwhelming. It's important to remember you are not alone in this. We can work together to find ways to cope. Have you noticed anything specific that triggered these thoughts? It could be anything. Stress from work, feeling isolated. Even small things can set me off. I have gone into deep depression just to think about why I am here. There is always a feeling in my mind that this world is not for me. Just finish this life. Stress and isolation can really intensify the feeling of depression. Have you had a chance to reach out to anyone like family, friends? Or when you are feeling this way? Not really. I feel like a burden. They won't understand. Plus, I don't want to worry them. I understand the concern, but it's really important to talk to someone about how you are feeling. You deserve support and people who care about you would want to know what you are going through. I guess I just don't want to drag anyone down with me. It's understandable to feel that way, but true friends and family will want to support you. You are not dragging them down. You are allowing them to be part of your journey. What about the coping strategies we talked about in our last session? Have you had any of those help at all? I try to meditate a bit, but my mind just races and I can't find the words for the journaling. That's perfect. Medication can be challenging, especially when you are feeling overwhelmed. How about trying shorter sessions or even just focusing on the breathing for a few minutes? I could try that. And for journaling, it does not have to be structured. Even a few bullet points about your feeling or what you are grateful for can help. Sometimes writing can be a release, even if it feels difficult. I'll give it a shot. Also, have you thought about any local support groups or online communities? I have looked a bit, but it feels daunting. It's understandable to feel that way. It might help to start small, maybe just reading some of the discussion or watching a video about someone's experience. You can decide later if you want to join in. That makes sense. Good. And remember, if you feel like you are in crisis or need immediate help due to suicidal thoughts or depression, please reach out to a hotline or a mental health service right away. Your safety is the most important thing. I know I have thought about it, but I don't know. It's okay to feel unsure. It's a lot to process. But if you ever feel overwhelmed or have suicidal thoughts, I want you to know that taking that step can be a sign of weakness. So you have to be strong and stay positive. It's just so hard sometimes. I believe you, it's hard. But it's okay to acknowledge that you are taking a brave step by being here and sharing how you feel. We will help working on this together, one step at a time. Thank you. It feels good to talk about it. I'm glad to hear that. Let's make a plan for the next few weeks. We can schedule our next appointment and I'll check in with you regularly. Yeah, that sounds good. Great. And remember, I'm here for you and you don't have to go through this alone. I appreciate that. Let's keep this conversation going and we'll find a way through this together. In the next appointment. Thank you.";"2024-09-30 12:12:32";"139";"T67090"

It's understandable to feel that way, but true friends and family will want to support you. You are not dragging them down. You are allowing them to be part of your journey. What about the coping strategies we talked about in our last session? Have you had any of those help at all? I try to meditate a bit, but my mind just races and I can't find the words for the journaling. That's perfect. Medication can be challenging, especially when you are feeling overwhelmed. How about trying shorter sessions or even just focusing on breathing for a few minutes? I could try that. For journaling, it does not have to be structured. Even a few bullet points about your feeling or what you are grateful for can help. Sometimes writing can be a release, even if it feels difficult. I'll give it a shot. Also, have you thought about any local support groups or online communities? I have looked a bit, but it feels daunting. It's understandable to feel that way. It might help to start small, maybe just reading some of the discussion or watching a video about someone's experience. You can decide later if you want to join in. That makes sense. Good. And remember, if you feel like you are in crisis or need immediate help due to suicidal thoughts or depression, please reach out to a hotline or a mental health service right away. Your safety is the most important thing. I know I have thought about it, but I don't know. It's okay to feel unsure. It's a lot to process. But if you ever feel overwhelmed or have suicidal thoughts, I want you to know that taking that step can be a sign of weakness. So you have to be strong and stay positive. It's just so hard sometimes. I believe you, it's hard. But it's okay to acknowledge that you are taking a brave step by being here and sharing how you feel. We will help working on this together, one step at a time. Thank you. It feels good to talk about it. I'm glad to hear that. Let's make a plan for the next few weeks. We can schedule our next appointment and I'll check in with you regularly. Yeah, that sounds good. Great. And remember, I'm here for you and you don't have to go through this alone. I appreciate that. Let's keep this conversation going and we'll find a way through this together. In the next appointment. See you.";"2024-09-27 13:39:25";"123";"MR-98012"
"Operative med on anesthesia is general endotracheal anesthesia per epidermis. This is a bi-distal ureteral calculus. Both epidermis, same procedure. Number one is suture with a file vaccine. Number two is right ureteral stem placement, comma, 6-inch by 26 centimeters. Number three, right LHG polygram. Complications, none drains. Twenty-fourth wrench thoroughly, fully with 30 cc's of sterile water in the balloon. Number one, number two, right ureteral stem placement, 6-inch by 26 centimeters. Fluid, 1,760 cc's, EBL minimal. Findings, 9-millimeter bi-distal ureteral calculus. Number one, number two, trial of a prosthetic enlargement with obstructive appearance. Summary, I'm sorry, specimen stone. Conditions stable, summary of patient was taken out, perineum placed in a fine position period after induction of general endotracheal anesthesia, common use, placed in a dorsal, fine position period, used prepped and direct, usual throat function period. The 22-french was a huge period, the urethra was examined in a period of normal period. The prostate was reached and had trial of a enlargement with obstructive appearance period. The bladder was easily entered period. The left ureteral office was very small and had quite a flexible input. The right ureteral office had a 9-millimeter calculus hanging off of it period. When filling the bladder with a cystic, this stone fell into the bladder period. It had a, I'm sorry, the 1,000 micron Holman laser was introduced through the cyst cup, and this plaque was fragmented using the laser period. The fragments were then removed with the electrovacuator and using the cochlear biopsy forceps to remove the larger fragments period. The right ureteral office was very deminous and could not be seen well to perform a right retrograde palloram period. Therefore, indigo carmine was given intravenously period. It took 20 minutes to see indigo carmine efflux from either ureteral office. Please comment which time that did efflux from both period. The open-ended catheter was then passed through the cyst scope and a glide wire was passed up the ureter to the kidney end of the fluoroscopic fission period. The open-ended catheter was then passed over the glide wire up to the mid-ureter, and the glide wire was removed period. Contrast was injected through the high peak contrast injected through the open-ended catheter, performing a right retrograde palloram period. The right collecting system appeared normal without any hydronephrosis or evidence of filling defects period. There was drainage of high peak down the ureter, which drained easily, and the distal ureter appeared dilated, but there was no evidence of filling defects period. The glide wire was then passed up through the open-ended catheter to the kidney end of the fluoroscopic vision period. The open-ended catheter was removed, leaving the wire in place period. A six-inch by 26-centimeter wide double-j ureteral stent was passed over the glide wire. A comma on the glide wire was removed period. A curl was seen in the upper pole of the right kidney end of the fluoroscopic vision, a comma on the curl was seen in the bladder in the cyst scopic vision period. I attempted passing a Foley catheter. It was unsuccessful during this period. I attempted passing it with a catheter guide and it was still unsuccessful. Therefore, the 20-french Foley, three-way Foley catheter at the end, a hole-punched comma, narrowed period. The 22-french urticiscope was reintroduced in the bladder, and the glide wire was passed into the bladder in the cyst scopic vision period. A 24-french Foley catheter was then passed over the glide wire into the bladder and here ingrained a light pink period. Two 30 cc's of sterile water was placed in the balloon period. The bag was then put to drainage period. The patient saw that the procedural wall column was exfiltrated, the column was taken to the post-stent and seizure care unit and satisfied to condition period.

"Hi, Mr. Jones. How are you? I'm good, Dr. Smith. Nice to see you. Nice to see you again. What brings you back? Well, my back's been hurting again. Oh, I see. I've seen you a number of times for this, haven't I? Yeah, well, ever since I got hurt on the job three years ago, it's something that just keeps coming back. It'll be fine for a while, and then I'll bend down or I'll move in a weird way, and then boom, it'll just go out again. Unfortunately, that can happen, and I do have quite a few patients who get reoccurring episodes of back pain. Have you been keeping up with the therapy that we had you on before? Which? The pills? Actually, I was talking about the physical therapy that we had you doing. The pills are only meant for short-term because they don't actually prevent the back pain from coming back. Yeah, once my back started feeling better, I was happy not to go to the therapist anymore. Why was that? It was starting to become kind of a hassle with my work schedule, and the cost was an issue, but I was able to get back to work, and I could use the money. Do you think the physical therapy was helping? Yeah, well, it was slow going at first. I see. Physical therapy is a bit slower than medications, but the point is to build up the core muscles in your back and your abdomen. Physical therapy is also less invasive than medications, so that's why we had you doing the therapy. But you mentioned that cost was getting to be a real issue for you. Can you tell me more about that? Well, the insurance I had only covered a certain number of sessions, and then they moved my therapy office because they were trying to work out my schedule at work, but that was really far away, and then I had to deal with parking, and it just started to get really expensive. Got it. I understand. So for now, I'd like you to try using a heating pad for your back pain. So that should help in the short term. Our goal is to get your back pain under better control without creating additional problems for you like cost. Let's talk about some different options and the pros and cons of each. So the physical therapy is actually really good for your back pain, but there are other things we can be doing to help. Yes, I definitely don't need to lose any more time at work and just lie around the house all day. Okay, well, there are some alternative therapies like yoga or tai chi classes or meditation therapies that might be able to help, and they might also be closer to you and be less expensive. Would that be something you'd be interested in? Sure, that'd be great. Good. Let's talk about some of the other costs of your care. In the past, we had you on some tramadol because the physical therapy alone wasn't working. Yes, that medicine was working really well, but again, the cost of it got really expensive. Yes, so that is something in the future we could order, something like a generic medication, and then there are also resources for people to look up the cheapest cost of their medications. But for now, I'd like to stick with the non-prescription medications, and if we can have you go to yoga or tai chi classes, like I mentioned, that could alleviate the need for ordering prescriptions. Okay, yes, that sounds good. Okay, great, great. Are there any other costs that are a problem for you in your care? Well, my insurance isn't going down, but that seems to be the case for everybody that I talk to, but I should be able to make it work. Unfortunately, that is an issue for a lot of people, but I would encourage you during open season to look at your different insurance options to see which plan is more cost-effective for you. Okay, yes, that sounds great. Great, great. I appreciate you talking to me today. Yes, I'm glad you were able to come in. What I'll do is I'll have my office team research the different things that you and I talked about today, and then let's set a time early next week, say Tuesday, where we can talk over the phone about what we were able to come up with for you and see if those would work for you. Okay, great. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.";"2024-09-27 12:10:39";"136";"PATIENT-TWO-SEP-27"
"Start. Good morning Mr. Johnson. It's great to see you again. How have you been? Oh hey Dr. Smith. Uh, I've been better to be very honest. I am sorry to hear that. Before we dive into what's bothering you, how's that garden of yours coming along? Last time we talked, you were excited about your tomatoes. Oh the garden. It's actually doing pretty well. The tomatoes are ripening nicely. You should see them. They're huge. That's fantastic. I might have to stop by for some fresh produce one of these days. Now, what seems to be the issue today? Well Doc, I've been having these, uh, weird symptoms. It's hard to explain. Take your time Mr. Johnson. I'm here to listen. Okay, so I've been feeling really tired lately. Like, exhausted all the time. And I've lost some weight without trying. I see. How long has this been going on? Uh, I'd say about three months now. Have you noticed any other changes or symptoms? Yeah, actually I've been sweating a lot at night. And I've this persistent cough that won't go away. I see. That does sound concerning. Let's dive a bit deeper into your symptoms and medical history. Have you had any fevers? Now that you mention it, yeah. I've had some low-grade fevers on and off. Okay, and how about your appetite? Any changes there? It's not great. I don't feel like eating much these days. I understand now. Let's talk about your medical history. Any chronic conditions we should be aware of? Well, you know about my high blood pressure. Oh, and I had that bout of pneumonia last year. Oh yes, I remember. How about your family history? Any significant illnesses? My dad had lung cancer and my mom has diabetes. I see. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Are you still smoking? Uh, yeah. I know I should quit, dog. I understand. It's difficult. But quitting would significantly improve your health. We can discuss some strategies later. But how about alcohol consumption? Just a beer or two on weekends. Alright, now given your symptoms and history, I think we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Oh boy, what kind of tests are we talking about? Well, we'll start with some blood work to check for any abnormalities. I'd also like to get a chest x-ray and possibly a CT scan. Wow, that sounds serious. It's important to be thorough, Mr. Johnson. We want to rule out any serious conditions and get to the bottom of your symptoms. I understand. What are you thinking it might be? Well, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Given your symptoms, the fatigue, weight loss, night sweats and persistent cough, we need to rule out conditions like tuberculosis, lymphoma or even lung cancer. But let's not jump to conclusions before we have the test results. Cancer? Oh man, that's scary. I know, it sounds frightening. But remember, we are just being cautious and thorough. It could also be something less serious like an autoimmune disorder or a chronic infection. That's why we need these tests. Okay, Doc, I trust you. What's next? Here's what we are going to do. First, we'll get your blood work done today. I'll also schedule you for a chest x-ray this week. Once we have those results, we'll decide if we need further imaging like a CT scan. All right. And how long will it take to get the results? The blood work should be back in a couple of days. The x-ray results we can usually get within 24 hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them. Okay. And what about, you know, while we're waiting? Great question. For now, I want you to rest as much as possible. Stay hydrated and try to eat nutritious meals, even if you don't have much appetite. If your fever spikes or you develop any new symptoms, call me immediately. Got it. Anything else I should do or avoid? Yes, actually, it's crucial that you avoid smoking as much as possible. I know it's hard, but it could make a significant difference in your symptoms and overall health. I'll try my best, doc. I appreciate that, Mr. Johnson. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns? I guess I'm just worried, you know. That's completely understandable. It's natural to feel anxious and when facing health uncertainties. But remember, we are partners in this. We'll figure it out together, okay? Thanks, doc. That means a lot. You're welcome. Oh, before I forget, how is your daughter doing? She was preparing for her college exams last time we spoke. Oh, she's doing great. She's actually got accepted to her top choice. That's wonderful news. Congratulations to her. You must be very proud. I really am. Thanks for remembering, doc. Of course. It's always a pleasure to hear good news. Now, let's get you set up for those tests. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and I'll see you again once we have the results. Sounds good, doc. Thanks for everything. You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Take care and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Before you go, Mr. Johnson, I'd like to prescribe some medications to help manage your symptoms while we wait for the test results. Okay. What kind of medications are we talking about? Well, first I'm going to prescribe an inhaler to help with your cough and any potential breathing difficulties. It's called Albuterol. An inhaler? I've never used one before. Don't worry. It's quite simple to use. The pharmacist will demonstrate to you how to use it and give you a prescription. The pharmacist will demonstrate how to use it properly. You'll need to take two puffs every four to six hours as needed. All right. I think I can manage that. Good. Now, for your fever and any discomfort, I'm prescribing acetaminophen. It's an over-the-counter medication, but I want you to take it regularly. Is that like Tylenol? Exactly. Take 650 mg every six hours. This should help with the fever and any pain you might be experiencing. Got it. Anything else? Yes. I'm also prescribing a cough suppressant with choline. It's called Uvefinacin with choline. This should help with your persistent cough, especially at night. Oh, that sounds good. The cough has been keeping me up all night. I understand. Take 10 ml of the syrup every four to six hours as needed, but be careful. It might make you drowsy, so you don't drive after taking it. Noted. Any side effects I should know about? Good question. The most common side effects for these medications include dizziness, dry mouth, and mild nausea. If you experience any severe side effects or allergic reactions, stop taking the medication and call me immediately. Okay. I'll keep an eye out for that for sure. Now, I also want to address your nutrition. Given your reduced appetite, I am recommending a high-calorie, high-protein nutritional shake. You can get these over the counter. Try to drink one or two a day between meals. That sounds doable. Excellent. Oh, and one more thing. I'm prescribing a nicotine patch to help with your smoking cessation efforts. Oh boy, I guess it's time, huh? It really is, Mr. Johnson. The patch will help manage your cravings. Start with a 21 mg patch and wear it for 24 hours. We'll gradually reduce the dosage over time. All right, Doc. I'll give it a shot. I'm proud of you for taking this step. Now, let's recap your treatment plan. Albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Acetaminophen, 650 mg every 6 hours. We're finishing with codeine, 10 ml, 4 to 6 hours as needed. Nutritional shakes, 1 to 2 per day between meals. Nicotine patch, 21 mg, worn for 24 hours. Do you have any questions about these medications or the treatment plan? Um, I think I got it all. But what about side effects if I take all of these together? That's a great question. These medications are generally safe to take together. But it's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. The main thing to watch out for is increased drowsiness, especially when you take the coxswirl. If you feel excessively drowsy, let me know and we can adjust the dosages. Okay, that makes sense. And how long will I need to take these? For now, let's plan on two weeks. By then, we should have all your test results and a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll reassess your medications at your follow-up appointment. Two weeks, got it. Oh, one more thing. Is it okay if I still work on my garden? Light gardening should be fine, Mr. Johnson. In fact, some gentle activity can be beneficial. Just make sure you don't overexert yourself. Stay hydrated and take breaks when you feel tired. That's a relief. Gardening really helps me, you know, takes my mind off things. I completely understand. It's great stress reliever. Just remember to wear a mask if you are dealing with soil or compost as a precaution. Will do, doc. Thanks for everything. You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Remember, if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to call me. We are in this together. I really appreciate that, doc. I'll see you in two weeks, right? That's right. Take care and good luck with those tomatoes. Thanks, doc. I might save you a few if they turn out good. I look forward to that. Take care, Mr. Johnson.";"2024-09-27 10:14:11";"135";"PATIENT-ONE-SEP-27"
"Patient. Good morning, doctor. I've been having some issues with my back lately, and it's starting to interfere with my daily activities. I was hoping you could help me figure out what's going on. Doctor. Good morning. I'm sorry to hear you've been dealing with back pain. Let's start by discussing your symptoms in more detail. When did the pain begin, and can you describe what it feels like? Patient. The pain started about three weeks ago. It began as a dull ache in my lower back, but over the past week, it's become sharper and more intense, especially when I bend over or lift something heavy. It's mostly in my lower back, but sometimes I feel it shooting down my left leg. Doctor. It sounds like you're experiencing sciatica, which is pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, typically starting in the lower back and traveling down the leg. Sciatica is often caused by a herniated disc or a bone spur compressing the nerve. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your leg? Patient. Yes, I have. Sometimes my leg feels tingly, and I've noticed that it's weaker than usual, especially when I'm trying to stand up from a sitting position. It's really affecting my ability to move around. Doctor. That's definitely concerning. Sciatica can be quite painful and debilitating. Let's talk about any activities or incidents that might have triggered this pain. Did you lift something heavy or twist your back awkwardly before the pain started? Patient. I think it might have started after I helped a friend move some furniture. I didn't feel anything at the time, but the next day, my back was really sore. I thought it would go away with rest, but it's just gotten worse. Doctor. Lifting heavy objects, especially without proper form, can put a lot of strain on the lower back and lead to injuries like muscle strains, herniated discs, or even ligament damage. It's possible that lifting the furniture caused a disc in your lower back to herniate or bulge, which could be pressing on your sciatic nerve. Patient. I was afraid of that. What kind of tests or exams do I need to determine if it's a herniated disc? Doctor. We'll start with a physical examination to assess your range of motion, strength, and reflexes. I'll also check for any signs of nerve compression, such as numbness or tingling in your leg. If we suspect a herniated disc or another structural issue, I may recommend imaging tests like an MRI, which provides a detailed view of the soft tissues in your back, including the discs and nerves. Patient. That makes sense. What kind of treatment options are available if it turns out to be a herniated disc? Doctor. Treatment for a herniated disc often starts with conservative measures. These can include physical therapy. A physical therapist can guide you through exercises to strengthen the muscles around your spine, improve flexibility, and reduce pressure on the affected nerve. This can help alleviate pain and prevent further injury. Medications over the counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce pain and inflammation. In some cases, muscle relaxants or prescription pain medications may be necessary. Hot and cold therapy. Applying ice to the affected area can help reduce inflammation in the first 48 hours, followed by heat therapy to relax the muscles and improve blood flow. Lifestyle modifications. It's important to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain, such as heavy lifting or prolonged sitting. Maintaining good posture, using ergonomic furniture, and practicing proper body mechanics can also help. Epidural steroid. Injections. If your pain is severe and not improving with other treatments, an epidural steroid injection can reduce inflammation and provide relief. This involves injecting a corticosteroid directly into the area around the nerve. Surgery. Surgery is usually considered a last resort when conservative treatments have failed to relieve symptoms and there's significant nerve compression causing pain, weakness, or loss of function. Procedures like a microdiscectomy, where the herniated portion of the disc is removed, can be very effective. Patient. I'd like to avoid surgery if possible. How long do you think it might take to feel better with physical therapy and other conservative treatments? Doctor. Most people with a herniated disc start to feel better within a few weeks to a few months with conservative treatments. It's important to be patient and consistent with your physical therapy exercises and to make the necessary lifestyle adjustments. Avoiding activities that strain your back and focusing on strengthening your core muscles can make a big difference. Patient. I'll do whatever it takes. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again? Doctor. Preventing future back problems involves a combination of strengthening exercises, proper body mechanics, and lifestyle changes. Here are some tips. Strengthen your core. A strong core helps support your spine and reduces the risk of injury. Exercises like planks, bridges, and pelvic tilts can be very beneficial. Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight, especially around the abdomen, puts extra strain on your lower back. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise can help reduce this strain. Practice good posture. Whether you're sitting, standing, or lifting, maintaining proper posture is key to protecting your back. Keep your back straight, shoulders back, and avoid slouching. Use proper lifting techniques. When lifting heavy objects, bend at the knees, not at the waist. Keep the object close to your body and use your leg muscles to lift rather than your back. Stay active. Regular physical activity helps keep your back muscles flexible and strong. Low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or cycling are great for maintaining overall back health. Ergonomics. Make sure your work environment is ergonomically friendly. Use a chair that supports your lower back. Keep your computer monitor at eye level, and take breaks to stretch if you're sitting for long periods. Patient. Those are great tips. I'll definitely work on incorporating them into my daily routine. Should I follow up with you after starting treatment? Doctor. Yes, I'd like to see you in about four to six weeks to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. If you're not seeing improvement or if your symptoms worsen, we may need to consider additional treatments or refer you to a specialist. In the meantime, if you have any concerns or if your pain becomes unmanageable, don't hesitate to contact me. Patient. I appreciate that. Doctor. I feel more confident about managing this now. I'll start with the physical therapy and the other recommendations you've made. Doctor. I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it's important to be consistent with your exercises and mindful of your body mechanics. With time and effort, most people with back problems see significant improvement. We'll work together to get you back to feeling your best. Patient. Thank you, doctor. I'll see you in a few weeks. Doctor. You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you soon.";"2024-09-27 09:52:31";"132";"B12_0012"

"Diksha, a 27 year old girl, Diksha explained that she had been experiencing persistent headaches and occasional dizziness for the past couple of weeks, which was starting to interfere with her daily activities. So Dr. Smith asked for more details about the headaches and the patient described them as throbbing pains around the temples and behind the eyes, often worse in the morning and sometimes lasting the entire day. The patient also mentioned accompanying symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to bright light. Dr. Smith inquired about any recent lifestyle changes and the patient admitted to increase work related stress and poor sleep, often getting only five hours of sleep a night. The doctor asked if the patient had a history of migraines or sinus issues and the patient confirmed occasional migraines in the past, usually triggered by certain foods, but noted that these current headaches felt different. Dr. Smith asked the patient to elaborate on his daily routine to better understand any potential contributing factors. The patient explained that he works in a high-pressure job, often staring at computer screens for long hours without taking sufficient breaks. He also mentioned a poor diet, relying on fast food and caffeine to get through the day and noted that exercise had fallen by the wayside due to his busy schedule. Dr. Smith noted thoughtfully taking notes and considering how these factors might be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient also mentioned trying a mirror front which provided limited relief and other measures like drinking more water and taking breaks during work, but nothing seemed to make a significant difference. Dr. Smith then performed a thorough physical examination. He checked the patient's blood pressure which was slightly elevated and measured his heart rate. He examined the patient's eye for any signs of strain or other issues and tested his reflexes and coordination to rule out any neurological problems. The doctor also palpated the patient's neck and shoulders, noting significant tension in these areas which could be contributing to the headaches. After the examination, Dr. Smith explained that the symptom could be due to several factors including stress, lack of sleep and possibly migraines. He suggested some initial steps such as improving hydration, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and trying relaxing techniques like deep breathing exercise, meditation or yoga. He also recommended that the patient keep a headache diary to track the frequency, duration and intensity of the headaches along with any potential triggers. Dr. Smith advised the patient to avoid known migraine triggers like certain foods and to try to manage stress through regular physical activity or mindfulness practices. Dr. Smith elaborated on the importance of a balanced diet, suggesting the patient incorporate more fruits, vegetables and whole grains and reduce the intake of caffeine and processed foods. Processed foods are too harmful for the body and caffeine will never ever get you sleep as early. So, he recommended the patient to set regular breaks during work to avoid prolonged sleep time and practice the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eyestrain. Dr. Smith suggested over-the-counter options like acetamiphone or naproxen as alternatives to ibuprofen and recommended the patient consider lifestyle changes such as reducing screen time before bed and creating a more restful sleep environment including keeping the bedroom cool and dark, avoiding screens for at least an hour before bedtime and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. Yes, that's good to hear. Yes. Dr. Smith discussed the possibility of using apps or wearable devices to monitor stress levels and encourage mindfulness and physical activity. He also mentioned that if the headaches persisted or worsened, prescription medications or referral to a neurologist for further evaluation might be necessary. The doctor reassured the patient that many people experience similar symptoms due to lifestyle factors and that making these changes could significantly improve high quality of life. Finally, Dr. Smith advised scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to monitor progress and discuss further tests or referrals to a specialist. If the headache persisted, he provided the patient with an educational pamphlet on stress management, sleep hygiene, and dietary changes. The patient thanked Dr. Smith for his thorough assessment and left the office feeling hopeful about managing his symptoms with the new strategies suggested and thanked for the same.";"2024-09-27 06:55:57";"133";"ALAX-007"

"Good morning, Junaid. How are you feeling today? Morning, doctor. I've been having this sharp pain in my lower back for the past few days. It's worse when I try to lift something or bend down. I'm sorry to hear that. On a scale of 1 to 10, how intense is the pain? It's around 7 most of the time, but it spikes to 9 if I make a sudden movement. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse? Resting on a flat surface helps a bit, but standing or walking for too long makes it worse. Have you had any other symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness in your legs? No numbness or tingling, but my lower back feels stiff in the morning. I see. Have you experienced anything like this before? I had some back pain a few years ago after a minor accident, but it wasn't this bad, and it went away after a couple of days with rest. Doc, thank you for sharing that, Junaid. Let me take a closer look now. The doctor performs a physical examination, checking the range of motion, tenderness, and muscle strength. From what I can tell, it seems like you might have a muscle strain in your lower back. Your range of motion is slightly limited, and there's some tenderness in the muscles. There doesn't seem to be any nerve involvement, which is a good sign. That's a relief to hear. What do you suggest we do? I recommend you continue resting and avoid lifting heavy objects for the next few days. I'll prescribe a muscle relaxant and some pain relief medication to help with the discomfort. You should also apply ice to the area for the first 48 hours, followed by heat therapy to relax the muscles. If the pain persists or worsens, we might consider physical therapy. Thank you, doctor. I'll follow your advice. You're welcome, Junaid. Let's plan to follow up in a week to see how you're doing. If you experience any new symptoms or if the pain doesn't improve, please contact me right away. I will. Thank you.";"2024-09-26 13:30:51";"129";"PATIENT-ONE-SEP-26"
"Start. Good morning Mr. Johnson. It's great to see you again. How have you been? Oh hey Dr. Smith. Uh, I've been better to be very honest. I am sorry to hear that. Before we dive into what's bothering you, how's that garden of yours coming along? Last time we talked, you were excited about your tomatoes. Oh the garden. It's actually doing pretty well. The tomatoes are ripening nicely. You should see them. They're huge. That's fantastic. I might have to stop by for some fresh produce one of these days. Now, what seems to be the issue today? Well Doc, I've been having these, uh, weird symptoms. It's hard to explain. Take your time Mr. Johnson. I'm here to listen. Okay, so I've been feeling really tired lately. Like, exhausted all the time. And I've lost some weight without trying. I see. How long has this been going on? Uh, I'd say about three months now. Have you noticed any other changes or symptoms? Yeah, actually I've been sweating a lot at night. And I've this persistent cough that won't go away. I see. That does sound concerning. Let's dive a bit deeper into your symptoms and medical history. Have you had any fevers? Now that you mention it, yeah. I've had some low-grade fevers on and off. Okay, and how about your appetite? Any changes there? It's not great. I don't feel like eating much these days. I understand now. Let's talk about your medical history. Any chronic conditions we should be aware of? Well, you know about my high blood pressure. Oh, and I had that bout of pneumonia last year. Oh yes, I remember. How about your family history? Any significant illnesses? My dad had lung cancer and my mom has diabetes. I see. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Are you still smoking? Uh, yeah. I know I should quit, dog. I understand. It's difficult. But quitting would significantly improve your health. We can discuss some strategies later. But how about alcohol consumption? Just a beer or two on weekends. Alright, now given your symptoms and history, I think we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Oh boy, what kind of tests are we talking about? Well, we'll start with some blood work to check for any abnormalities. I'd also like to get a chest x-ray and possibly a CT scan. Wow, that sounds serious. It's important to be thorough, Mr. Johnson. We want to rule out any serious conditions and get to the bottom of your symptoms. I understand. What are you thinking it might be? Well, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Given your symptoms, the fatigue, weight loss, night sweats and persistent cough, we need to rule out conditions like tuberculosis, lymphoma or even lung cancer. But let's not jump to conclusions before we have the test results. Cancer? Oh man, that's scary. I know, it sounds frightening. But remember, we are just being cautious and thorough. It could also be something less serious like an autoimmune disorder or a chronic infection. That's why we need these tests. Okay, Doc, I trust you. What's next? Here's what we are going to do. First, we'll get your blood work done today. I'll also schedule you for a chest x-ray this week. Once we have those results, we'll decide if we need further imaging like a CT scan. All right. And how long will it take to get the results? The blood work should be back in a couple of days. The x-ray results we can usually get within 24 hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them. Okay. And what about, you know, while we're waiting? Great question. For now, I want you to rest as much as possible. Stay hydrated and try to eat nutritious meals, even if you don't have much appetite. If your fever spikes or you develop any new symptoms, call me immediately. Got it. Anything else I should do or avoid? Yes, actually, it's crucial that you avoid smoking as much as possible. I know it's hard, but it could make a significant difference in your symptoms and overall health. I'll try my best, doc. I appreciate that, Mr. Johnson. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns? I guess I'm just worried, you know. That's completely understandable. It's natural to feel anxious and when facing health uncertainties. But remember, we are partners in this. We'll figure it out together, okay? Thanks, doc. That means a lot. You're welcome. Oh, before I forget, how is your daughter doing? She was preparing for her college exams last time we spoke. Oh, she's doing great. She's actually got accepted to her top choice. That's wonderful news. Congratulations to her. You must be very proud. I really am. Thanks for remembering, doc. Of course. It's always a pleasure to hear good news. Now, let's get you set up for those tests. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and I'll see you again once we have the results. Sounds good, doc. Thanks for everything. You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Take care and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Before you go, Mr. Johnson, I'd like to prescribe some medications to help manage your symptoms while we wait for the test results. Okay. What kind of medications are we talking about? Well, first I'm going to prescribe an inhaler to help with your cough and any potential breathing difficulties. It's called Albuterol. An inhaler? I've never used one before. Don't worry. It's quite simple to use. The pharmacist will demonstrate to you how to use it and give you a prescription. The pharmacist will demonstrate how to use it properly. You'll need to take two puffs every four to six hours as needed. All right. I think I can manage that. Good. Now, for your fever and any discomfort, I'm prescribing acetaminophen. It's an over-the-counter medication, but I want you to take it regularly. Is that like Tylenol? Exactly. Take 650 mg every six hours. This should help with the fever and any pain you might be experiencing. Got it. Anything else? Yes. I'm also prescribing a cough suppressant with choline. It's called Uvefinacin with choline. This should help with your persistent cough, especially at night. Oh, that sounds good. The cough has been keeping me up all night. I understand. Take 10 ml of the syrup every four to six hours as needed, but be careful. It might make you drowsy, so you don't drive after taking it. Noted. Any side effects I should know about? Good question. The most common side effects for these medications include dizziness, dry mouth, and mild nausea. If you experience any severe side effects or allergic reactions, stop taking the medication and call me immediately. Okay. I'll keep an eye out for that for sure. Now, I also want to address your nutrition. Given your reduced appetite, I am recommending a high-calorie, high-protein nutritional shake. You can get these over the counter. Try to drink one or two a day between meals. That sounds doable. Excellent. Oh, and one more thing. I'm prescribing a nicotine patch to help with your smoking cessation efforts. Oh boy, I guess it's time, huh? It really is, Mr. Johnson. The patch will help manage your cravings. Start with a 21 mg patch and wear it for 24 hours. We'll gradually reduce the dosage over time. All right, Doc. I'll give it a shot. I'm proud of you for taking this step. Now, let's recap your treatment plan. Albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Acetaminophen, 650 mg every 6 hours. We're finishing with codeine, 10 ml, 4 to 6 hours as needed. Nutritional shakes, 1 to 2 per day between meals. Nicotine patch, 21 mg, worn for 24 hours. Do you have any questions about these medications or the treatment plan? Um, I think I got it all. But what about side effects if I take all of these together? That's a great question. These medications are generally safe to take together. But it's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. The main thing to watch out for is increased drowsiness, especially when you take the coxswirl. If you feel excessively drowsy, let me know and we can adjust the dosages. Okay, that makes sense. And how long will I need to take these? For now, let's plan on two weeks. By then, we should have all your test results and a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll reassess your medications at your follow-up appointment. Two weeks, got it. Oh, one more thing. Is it okay if I still work on my garden? Light gardening should be fine, Mr. Johnson. In fact, some gentle activity can be beneficial. Just make sure you don't overexert yourself. Stay hydrated and take breaks when you feel tired. That's a relief. Gardening really helps me, you know, takes my mind off things. I completely understand. It's great stress reliever. Just remember to wear a mask if you are dealing with soil or compost as a precaution. Will do, doc. Thanks for everything. You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Remember, if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to call me. We are in this together. I really appreciate that, doc. I'll see you in two weeks, right? That's right. Take care and good luck with those tomatoes. Thanks, doc. I might save you a few if they turn out good. I look forward to that. Take care, Mr. Johnson.";"2024-09-26 12:03:50";"60";"hhhhhh"
"Good morning Jamie, it's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last appointment? Honestly not great, I have been feeling really low. Some days are worse than others. I'm sorry to hear that. It's okay to have ups and downs but can you tell me more about what you have been experiencing lately? I feel tired all the time. I'm dragging myself throughout the day and my thoughts just won't go away. I'm dealing with depression and in the past few days I also tried to kill myself by hanging through a ceiling fan. I'm sorry to hear that. You mentioned your thoughts that are troubling. Can you share more about those? I had these suicidal thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore. I know I have been through this before and I tried. I appreciate you being so open about this. It's important to talk about these suicidal thoughts and these mental feelings you are dealing with. How often are you experiencing these thoughts now compared to before? It's still pretty frequent. Some days I feel I'm fighting myself just to stay alive. But I keep thinking about killing myself because I'm too depressed of my life. That sounds incredibly overwhelming Jami. It's important to remember you are not alone in this. We can work together to find ways to cope. Have you noticed anything specific that triggered these thoughts? It could be anything. Stress from work, feeling isolated. Even small things can set me off. I have gone into deep depression just to think about why I am here. There is always a feeling occurring in my mind that this world is not for me. Just finish this life. Stress and isolation can really intensify the feeling of depression. Have you had a chance to reach out to anyone like family, friends? Or when you are feeling this way? Not really. I feel like a burden. They won't understand. Plus, I don't want to worry them. I understand the concern but it's really important to talk to someone about how you are feeling. You deserve support and people who care about you would want to know what you are going through. I guess I just don't want to drag anyone down with me. It's understandable to feel that way but true friends and family will want to support you. You are not dragging them down. You are allowing them to be part of your journey. What about the coping strategies we talked about in our last session? Have you had any of those help at all? I try to meditate a bit but my mind just races and the journaling sometimes I just can't find the words. That's perfect. Okay. Medication can be challenging especially when you are feeling overwhelmed. How about trying shorter sessions or even just focusing on the breathing for a few minutes? I could try that. And for journaling, it does not have to be structured. Even a few bullet points about your feeling or what you are grateful for can help. Sometimes writing can be a release even if it feels difficult. I'll give it a shot. Great. Also, have you thought about any local support groups or online communities? I have looked a bit but it feels daunting. It's understandable to feel that way. It might help to start small. Maybe just reading some of the discussion or watching a video about someone's experience. You can decide later if you want to join in. That makes sense. Good. And remember, if you feel like you are in crisis or need immediate help due to suicidal thoughts or depression, please reach out to a hotline or a mental health service right away. Your safety is the most important thing. I know I have thought about it but I don't know. It's okay to feel unsure. It's a lot to process. But if you ever feel overwhelmed or have suicidal thoughts, I want you to know that taking that step can be a sign of weakness. So you have to be strong and stay positive. It's just so hard sometimes. I believe you, it's hard. But it's okay to acknowledge that you are taking a brave step by being here and sharing how you feel. We will help working on this together, one step at a time. Thank you. It feels good to talk about it. I'm glad to hear that. Let's make a plan for the next few weeks. We can schedule our next appointment and I'll check in with you regularly. Yeah, that sounds good. Great. And remember, I'm here for you and you don't have to go through this alone. I appreciate that. Let's keep this conversation going and we'll find a way through this together. In the next appointment. See you.";"2024-09-26 09:47:32";"126";"JM00124"

Alright, now given your symptoms and history, I think we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Oh boy, what kind of tests are we talking about? Well, we'll start with some blood work to check for any abnormalities. I'd also like to get a chest x-ray and possibly a CT scan. Wow, that sounds serious. It's important to be thorough, Mr. Johnson. We want to rule out any serious conditions and get to the bottom of your symptoms. I understand. What are you thinking it might be? Well, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Given your symptoms, the fatigue, weight loss, night sweats and persistent cough, we need to rule out conditions like tuberculosis, lymphoma or even lung cancer. But let's not jump to conclusions before we have the test results. Cancer? Oh man, that's scary. I know, it sounds frightening. But remember, we are just being cautious and thorough. It could also be something less serious like an autoimmune disorder or a chronic infection. That's why we need these tests. Okay, Doc, I trust you. What's next? Here's what we are going to do. First, we'll get your blood work done today. I'll also schedule you for a chest x-ray this week. Once we have those results, we'll decide if we need further imaging like a CT scan. All right. And how long will it take to get the results? The blood work should be back in a couple of days. The x-ray results we can usually get within 24 hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them. Okay. And what about, you know, while we're waiting? Great question. For now, I want you to rest as much as possible. Stay hydrated and try to eat nutritious meals, even if you don't have much appetite. If your fever spikes or you develop any new symptoms, call me immediately. Got it. Anything else I should do or avoid? Yes, actually, it's crucial that you avoid smoking as much as possible. I know it's hard, but it could make a significant difference in your symptoms and overall health. I'll try my best, doc. I appreciate that, Mr. Johnson. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns? I guess I'm just worried, you know. That's completely understandable. It's natural to feel anxious and when facing health uncertainties. But remember, we are partners in this. We'll figure it out together, okay? Thanks, doc. That means a lot. You're welcome. Oh, before I forget, how is your daughter doing? She was preparing for her college exams last time we spoke. Oh, she's doing great. She's actually got accepted to her top choice. That's wonderful news. Congratulations to her. You must be very proud. I really am. Thanks for remembering, doc. Of course. It's always a pleasure to hear good news. Now, let's get you set up for those tests. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and I'll see you again once we have the results. Sounds good, doc. Thanks for everything. You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Take care and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Before you go, Mr. Johnson, I'd like to prescribe some medications to help manage your symptoms while we wait for the test results. Okay. What kind of medications are we talking about? Well, first I'm going to prescribe an inhaler to help with your cough and any potential breathing difficulties. It's called Albuterol. An inhaler? I've never used one before. Don't worry. It's quite simple to use. The pharmacist will demonstrate to you how to use it and give you a prescription. The pharmacist will demonstrate how to use it properly. You'll need to take two puffs every four to six hours as needed. All right. I think I can manage that. Good. Now, for your fever and any discomfort, I'm prescribing acetaminophen. It's an over-the-counter medication, but I want you to take it regularly. Is that like Tylenol? Exactly. Take 650 mg every six hours. This should help with the fever and any pain you might be experiencing. Got it. Anything else? Yes. I'm also prescribing a cough suppressant with choline. It's called Uvefinacin with choline. This should help with your persistent cough, especially at night. Oh, that sounds good. The cough has been keeping me up all night. I understand. Take 10 ml of the syrup every four to six hours as needed, but be careful. It might make you drowsy, so you don't drive after taking it. Noted. Any side effects I should know about? Good question. The most common side effects for these medications include dizziness, dry mouth, and mild nausea. If you experience any severe side effects or allergic reactions, stop taking the medication and call me immediately. Okay. I'll keep an eye out for that for sure. Now, I also want to address your nutrition. Given your reduced appetite, I am recommending a high-calorie, high-protein nutritional shake. You can get these over the counter. Try to drink one or two a day between meals. That sounds doable. Excellent. Oh, and one more thing. I'm prescribing a nicotine patch to help with your smoking cessation efforts. Oh boy, I guess it's time, huh? It really is, Mr. Johnson. The patch will help manage your cravings. Start with a 21 mg patch and wear it for 24 hours. We'll gradually reduce the dosage over time. All right, Doc. I'll give it a shot. I'm proud of you for taking this step. Now, let's recap your treatment plan. Albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Acetaminophen, 650 mg every 6 hours. We're finishing with codeine, 10 ml, 4 to 6 hours as needed. Nutritional shakes, 1 to 2 per day between meals. Nicotine patch, 21 mg, worn for 24 hours. Do you have any questions about these medications or the treatment plan? Um, I think I got it all. But what about side effects if I take all of these together? That's a great question. These medications are generally safe to take together. But it's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. The main thing to watch out for is increased drowsiness, especially when you take the coxswirl. If you feel excessively drowsy, let me know and we can adjust the dosages. Okay, that makes sense. And how long will I need to take these? For now, let's plan on two weeks. By then, we should have all your test results and a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll reassess your medications at your follow-up appointment. Two weeks, got it. Oh, one more thing. Is it okay if I still work on my garden? Light gardening should be fine, Mr. Johnson. In fact, some gentle activity can be beneficial. Just make sure you don't overexert yourself. Stay hydrated and take breaks when you feel tired. That's a relief. Gardening really helps me, you know, takes my mind off things. I completely understand. It's great stress reliever. Just remember to wear a mask if you are dealing with soil or compost as a precaution. Will do, doc. Thanks for everything. You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Remember, if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to call me. We are in this together. I really appreciate that, doc. I'll see you in two weeks, right? That's right. Take care and good luck with those tomatoes. Thanks, doc. I might save you a few if they turn out good. I look forward to that. Take care, Mr. Johnson.";"2024-09-26 09:35:21";"128";"PATIENT-TWO"
"Good morning, Junaid. How are you feeling today? Good morning, doctor. I have been having this sharp pain in my lower back for the past few days. It's worse when you try to lift something or bend down. I'm sorry to hear that. On a scale of 1 to 10, how intense is the pain? And what is your age? It's around 7 most of the time, but spikes to 9 if I make certain movement. And my age is 26. Have you noticed anything that makes the pain better or worse? Resting on a flat surface helps a bit, but standing or walking for too long makes it worse. Have you had any symptoms like numbness, tingling or weakness in your legs? No numbness or tingling, but my lower back feels stiff in the morning. Have you experienced anything like this before? I had some back pain a few years ago after a minor accident, but it was not this bad. And it went away after a couple of days with rest. Thank you for sharing that, Junaid. Let me take a closer look now. From what I can tell, it seems like you might have a muscle strain in your lower back. The range of motion is slightly limited and there is some tenderness in the muscles. There doesn't seem to be any nerve involvement, which is a good sign. That's a relief to hear. What do you suggest we do? I recommend you to continue resting and avoid lifting heavy objects for the next few days. I will prescribe a muscle relaxant and some pain relief medication to help with the discomfort. You should apply ice to the area for the first 48 hours, followed by the heat therapy to relax the muscles. If the pain persists or worsens, we might consider physical therapy. Thank you, doctor. I really follow your advice. You are welcome, Junaid. Let's plan to follow up in a week to see how you are doing. If you are experiencing any new symptoms or the pain does not improve, please contact me right away. I will thank you.";"2024-09-26 09:29:55";"100";"RD-PATIENT-ONE-SEP-20"

"Hi, Mr. Jones. How are you? I'm good, Dr. Smith. Nice to see you. Nice to see you again. What brings you back? Well, my back's been hurting again. Oh, I see. I've seen you a number of times for this, haven't I? Yeah, well, ever since I got hurt on the job three years ago, it's something that just keeps coming back. It'll be fine for a while, and then I'll bend down or I'll move in a weird way, and then boom, it'll just go out again. Unfortunately, that can happen, and I do have quite a few patients who get reoccurring episodes of back pain. Have you been keeping up with the therapy that we had you on before? Which? The pills? Actually, I was talking about the physical therapy that we had you doing. The pills are only meant for short-term because they don't actually prevent the back pain from coming back. Yeah, once my back started feeling better, I was happy not to go to the therapist anymore. Why was that? It was starting to become kind of a hassle with my work schedule, and the cost was an issue, but I was able to get back to work, and I could use the money. Do you think the physical therapy was helping? Yeah, well, it was slow going at first. I see. Physical therapy is a bit slower than medications, but the point is to build up the core muscles in your back and your abdomen. Physical therapy is also less invasive than medications, so that's why we had you doing the therapy. But you mentioned that cost was getting to be a real issue for you. Can you tell me more about that? Well, the insurance I had only covered a certain number of sessions, and then they moved my therapy office because they were trying to work out my schedule at work, but that was really far away, and then I had to deal with parking, and it just started to get really expensive. Got it. I understand. So for now, I'd like you to try using a heating pad for your back pain. So that should help in the short term. Our goal is to get your back pain under better control without creating additional problems for you like cost. Let's talk about some different options and the pros and cons of each. So the physical therapy is actually really good for your back pain, but there are other things we can be doing to help. Yes, I definitely don't need to lose any more time at work and just lie around the house all day. Okay, well, there are some alternative therapies like yoga or tai chi classes or meditation therapies that might be able to help, and they might also be closer to you and be less expensive. Would that be something you'd be interested in? Sure, that'd be great. Good. Let's talk about some of the other costs of your care. In the past, we had you on some tramadol because the physical therapy alone wasn't working. Yes, that medicine was working really well, but again, the cost of it got really expensive. Yes, so that is something in the future we could order, something like a generic medication, and then there are also resources for people to look up the cheapest cost of their medications. But for now, I'd like to stick with the non-prescription medications, and if we can have you go to yoga or tai chi classes, like I mentioned, that could alleviate the need for ordering prescriptions. Okay, yeah, that sounds good. Okay, great, great. Are there any other costs that are a problem for you in your care? Well, my insurance isn't going down, but that seems to be the case for everybody that I talk to, but I should be able to make it work. Yeah, unfortunately that is an issue for a lot of people, but I would encourage you during open season to look at your different insurance options to see which plan is more cost-effective for you. Okay, yeah, that sounds great. Great, great. I appreciate you talking to me today. Yeah, I'm glad you were able to come in. What I'll do is I'll have my office team research the different things that you and I talked about today, and then let's set a time early next week, say Tuesday, where we can talk over the phone about what we were able to come up with for you and see if those would work for you. Okay, great. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

"Good morning Jamie, it's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last appointment? Honestly not great, I have been feeling really low. Some days are worse than others. I'm sorry to hear that. It's okay to have ups and downs, but can you tell me more about what you have been experiencing lately? I feel tired all the time. I'm dragging myself throughout the day. My thoughts just won't go away. I'm dealing with depression and in the past few days I also tried to kill myself by hanging through a ceiling fan. I'm sorry to hear that. You mentioned your thoughts that are troubling. Can you share more about those? I had these suicidal thoughts about not wanting to be here anymore. I know I have been through this before and I tried. I appreciate you being so open about this. It's important to talk about these suicidal thoughts and these mental feelings you are dealing with. How often are you experiencing these thoughts now compared to before? It's still pretty frequent. Someday I feel I'm fighting myself just to stay alive. But I keep thinking about killing myself because I'm too depressed about my life. That sounds incredibly overwhelming, Jami. It's important to remember you're not alone in this. We can work together to find ways to cope. Have you noticed anything specific that triggered these thoughts? It could be anything. Stress from work, feeling isolated. Even small things can set me off. I have gone into deep depression just to think. Why am I here? There is always a feeling in my mind that this world is not for me. Just finish this life. Stress and isolation can really intensify the feeling of depression. Have you had a chance to reach out to anyone like family, friends? Or when you are feeling this way? Not really. I feel like a burden. They won't understand. Plus, I don't want to worry them. I understand the concern, but it's really important to talk to someone about how you are feeling. You deserve support and people who care about you would want to know what you are going through. I guess I just don't want to drag anyone down with me. It's understandable to feel that way. True friends and family will want to support you. You are not dragging them down. You are allowing them to be part of your journey. What about the coping strategies we talked about in our last session? Have you had any of those help at all? I try to meditate a bit, but my mind just races and the journaling sometimes I just can't find the words. That's perfect. Okay. Medication can be challenging, especially when you are feeling overwhelmed. How about trying shorter sessions or even just focusing on the breathing for a few minutes? I could try that. And for journaling, it does not have to be structured. Even a few bullet points about your feeling or what you are grateful for can help. Sometimes writing can be a release even if it feels difficult. I'll give it a shot. Great. Also, have you thought about any local support groups or online communities? I have looked a bit, but it feels daunting. It's understandable to feel that way. It might help to start small, maybe just reading some of the discussion or watching a video about someone's experience. You can decide later if you want to join in. That makes sense. Good. And remember, if you feel like you are in crisis or need immediate help due to suicidal thoughts or depression, please reach out to a hotline or a mental health service right away. Your safety is the most important thing. I know I have thought about it, but I don't know. It's okay to feel unsure. It's a lot to process. But if you ever feel overwhelmed or have suicidal thoughts, I want you to know that taking that step can be a sign of weakness. So you have to be strong and stay positive. It's just so hard sometimes. I believe you. It's hard. But it's okay to acknowledge that you are taking a brave step by being here and sharing how you feel. We will help working on this together, one step at a time. Thank you. It feels good to talk about it. I'm glad to hear that. Let's make a plan for the next few weeks. We can schedule our next appointment and I'll check in with you regularly. Yeah, that sounds good. Great. And remember, I'm here for you and you don't have to go through this alone. I appreciate that. Let's keep this conversation going and we'll find a way through this together. In the next appointment. Okay.";"2024-09-26 06:25:40";"126";"JM00124"

"Good morning Mr. Davis, how are you feeling today? Good morning doctor, honestly I am feeling a bit run down, the cough has gotten worse and I am having night sweats that keep me awake. I am sorry to hear that, let's go over your symptoms, how long has the cough been bothering you and have you noticed any other symptoms? It's been going on about 2 months now, it started as a dry cough but now it's quite persistent. I have also been sweating a lot at night and feeling more tired than usual, I have lost some weight too which worries me. Those are significant symptoms, it sounds like you might be dealing with tuberculosis or TB, we will need to run some tests to confirm this, in the meantime have you been managing at home? I have been trying to take it easy and stay hydrated, I have also been using the over the counter cough medicine but it doesn't seem to help much. It's been tough especially with the kids running around, I can imagine managing symptoms while keeping up with family life can be challenging, how is your family members handling everything? They are doing their best, my wife has been a rock through all this, managing the house and taking care of me, my kids are young so they don't fully understand but they are trying to be supportive. It's great that you have such a supportive family, have a good support system can make a big difference, how are you explaining things to your kids? We are keeping it simple, we tell them that I am sick and need to rest to get better, my wife is good at reassuring them and keeping their routines normal, that's a smart approach. If you ever need more guidance on how to talk to them or resources for support, just let me know, I am here to help. Thanks doctor, it might take you up on that and speaking of support, I am missing out on a lot of my regular activities, I used to play a local soccer league but I have had to stop, I understand how frustrating that can be, it's tough to give up activities you enjoy, soccer sounds like it was a big part of your routine. How long have you been playing? I have been playing since college, it's always been a great way for me to unwind and stay fit, not being able to play right now is one of the hardest part of this illness. I see, why that would be difficult getting back to the things you love is important for your overall well-being, once you have your TB diagnosis confirmed and you start treatment, you will need to rest and avoid strenuous activities for a while but hopefully you will be available to get back on the field sooner rather than later. I really hope so, I miss the camaraderie with my teammates and the thrill of the game, do you think I will be able to return to playing once I am better? Absolutely, with the right treatment, once you are fully recovered, you should be able to return to playing, it's important to follow the treatment plan closely and give yourself time to heal properly. It's great that you have something to look forward to, I am counting on it, what kind of treatment should I expect? TB treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and you will need to take for about 6-9 months, it's crucial to take all your medication as prescribed to fully eliminate the bacteria and prevent development of TB. 6-9 months sounds like a long time but I understand the importance, will I need to stay in the hospital during this time? Not necessary, most people with TB can be treated on an outpatient basis, you will need regular checkup to monitor your progress but hospitalization is generally only needed if there are complications or if the disease is more severe, that's good to hear. I had much rather to be at home with my family, I am also worried about my treatment, how my treatment will affect them, it's understandable to be concerned, you will need to follow precautions to prevent spreading TB such as covering your mouth, when you cough and ventilating your living space, using a mask can also help, your family should be fine as long as you follow these precautions and complete your treatment, I will make sure to do that, I don't want to put them at risk. By the way, how are you holding up doctor? I must be quite a job keeping track of all your patients, I appreciate you asking, it can be busy but it's rewarding to help people through their health challenges, I enjoy hearing about my parents' lives and interests, it helps me understand their situation better, that's nice to hear, it's been comforting to talk with you, do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work? I do enjoy gardening and reading, it's a nice way to unwind after a busy day, do you have any favourite activities or hobbies besides soccer? I used to enjoy woodworking as a hobby, I have not had much time for it lately but I had love to get back into it once I am feeling better, woodworking sounds like a fantastic and rewarding hobby, it's great to have creative outlets, once you are back on your feet, you will have plenty of time to dive back into it, in the meantime, if you need anything or just want to chat about soccer or woodworking, feel free to reach out, I'll keep that in mind, it's nice to have a doctor who takes the time to listen and engage, thanks for making this process a bit easier for me. You are welcome Mr. Davis, I am here to support you through this, let's get those tests scheduled and I'll follow up with you once we have the results, we'll work together to get you back to feeling your best, sounds like a plan, thanks again, doctor, I'll see you soon for the test, looking forward to it, take care Mr. Davis and remember, you are not alone in this, thanks doctor, I appreciate it.";"2024-09-25 13:02:17";"125";"RK_00234"

How long have you been playing? I have been playing since college, it's always been a great way for me to unwind and stay fit, not being able to play right now is one of the hardest part of this illness. I see, why that would be difficult getting back to the things you love is important for your overall well-being, once you have your TB diagnosis confirmed and you start treatment, you will need to rest and avoid strenuous activities for a while but hopefully you will be available to get back on the field sooner rather than later. I really hope so, I miss the camera diary with my teammates and the thrill of the game, do you think I will be able to return to playing once I am better? Absolutely, with the right treatment, once you are fully recovered, you should be able to return to playing, it's important to follow the treatment plan closely and give yourself time to heal properly, it's great that you have something to look forward to, I am counting on it, what kind of treatment should I expect? TB treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and you will need to take for about 6-9 months, it's crucial to take all your medication as prescribed to fully eliminate the bacteria and prevent development of drug resistant TB, 6-9 months sounds like a long time but I understand the importance, will I need to stay in the hospital during this time? Not necessary, most people with TB can be treated on an outpatient basis, you will need regular checkup to monitor your progress but hospitalization is generally only needed if there are complications or if the disease is more severe, that's good to hear, I had much rather to be at home with my family, I am also worried about my treatment, how my treatment will affect them, it's understandable to be concerned, you will need to follow precautions to prevent spreading TB such as covering your mouth, when you cough and ventilating your living space, using a mask can also help, your family should be fine as long as you follow these precautions and complete your treatment, I will make sure to do that, I don't want to put them at risk, by the way, how are you holding up doctor? It must be quite a job keeping track of all your patients, I appreciate you asking, it can be busy but it's rewarding to help people through their health challenges, I enjoy hearing about my parents living, lives and interests, it helps me understand their situation better, that's nice to hear, it's been comforting to talk with you, do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work? I do, I enjoy gardening and reading, it's a nice way to unwind after a busy day, do you have any favorite activities or hobbies besides soccer? I used to enjoy woodworking as a hobby, I have not had much time for it lately but I had love to get back into it once I'm feeling better, woodworking sounds like a fantastic and rewarding hobby, it's great to have creative outlets, once you are back on your feet, you will have plenty of time to dive back into it, in the meantime, if you need anything or just want to chat about soccer or woodworking, feel free to reach out, I'll keep that in mind, it's nice to have a doctor who takes the time to listen and engage, thanks for making this process a bit easier for me, you're welcome Mr. Davis, I'm here to support you through this, let's get those tests scheduled and I'll follow up with you once we have the results, we'll work together to get you back to feeling your best, sounds like a plan, that's again, thanks again doctor, I'll see you soon for the test, looking forward to it, take care Mr. Davis and remember you are not alone in this, thanks doctor, I appreciate it.";"2024-09-25 13:02:14";"125";"RK_00234"
"Good morning, how are you feeling today? Good morning, doctor. Honestly, I'm not feeling too great. I have been having a high fever and I'm really weak. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me when the symptoms started and how they have been progressing? It started about four days ago with a mild fever, but it's gotten worse. I have had high fever, severe headaches, joint pain and my body feels achy. I'm also feeling nauseous and I have been vomiting quite a bit. It sounds like you are going through a rough time. Have you had any rashes or bleeding issues like bleeding gums or nosebleeds? I have not had any bleeding, but I had noticed a rash developing yesterday. It's not too severe, just a bit of redness and small spots on my arms and legs. That's useful information based on your symptoms and the rash. Dengue fever is something we need to consider. Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause severe flu-like symptoms. Have you had any recent mosquito bites or travelled to areas known for dengue outbreaks? Yes, I did travel to a region where dengue is common about two weeks ago. I have been bitten by mosquitoes there and I did not really think much of it at that time. That's an important detail. Dengue fever usually has an incubation period of about 4-10 days. So, it makes sense that your symptoms have developed now. We need to do some tests to confirm it. If it's dengue and to assess the severity of your condition, what kind of tests will you be doing? We will start with a blood test to check for the presence of dengue virus or antibodies. We will also access your blood cell counts, especially your platelet levels as dengue can affect these. Additionally, we might need to do some tests to monitor your liver. And kidney function to see if there are any complications. That sounds thorough. I am a bit worried about my condition. What should I expect if it is dengue? It's understandable to be concerned that dengue can range from mild to severe. Most cases are mild and involve symptoms like high fever, pain and rash which usually involve on their own with proper care. However, in severe cases, it can lead to dengue, hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome which require more intense treatment and monitoring. What are the signs of severe dengue that I should watch out for? Severe dengue can persist with more serious symptoms such as persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, blood bleeding, gums, difficulty breathing and a significant drop in blood pressure. If you notice any of these symptoms, you need to seek medical help immediately. I'll keep an eye on that. How do you manage dengue fever? For most people, the management includes plenty of fresh fluids to stay hydrated and medications to manage symptoms like fever and pain. We usually advise avoiding medications like aspirin or non-stereotype anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs because they can increase the risk of bleeding. Is there anything specific I should eat or avoid? It's important to stay hydrated. So, drink plenty of fluids like water, oral rehydration solution or clear soups. Eating light and easily digestible food can also help if you are having nausea. Avoid oily and spicy food might be a good idea if your stomach is upset. What about my activity levels? Should I rest completely? Yes, rest is crucial. Avoid strenuous activities and ensure you get adequate sleep. Your body needs energy to fight off the infection to try to take it easy. How long will it take for me to start feeling better? Most people start feeling better within a week to 10 days. However, recovery can vary from person to person. It's important to follow up on your condition and adhere to any recommendations or treatment provided. I'll make sure to follow up your advice. How often should I come in for checkups? Initially, we need to monitor your condition closely. So, I would recommend coming in for follow-up visits every couple of days to track your progress. Once your symptoms start improving and your test results are more stable, we can adjust the frequency of visits. I appreciate your help and guidance, doctor. I'm a bit anxious now. But to expect your welcome, it's completely normal to feel anxious. But remember that we are here to support you through this. If you have any questions or concerns, in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you. I'll definitely keep in touch and follow your recommendations. Good. I'm glad to hear that. Make sure to take care of yourself. I'll see you at our next appointment. We'll do thanks again for everything. You're welcome. Take care and see you soon. Goodbye, doctor. Goodbye.";"2024-09-25 12:59:47";"125";"RK_00234"
"Diksha, a 27 year old girl, Diksha explained that she had been experiencing persistent headaches and occasional dizziness for the past couple of weeks, which was starting to interfere with her daily activities. So Dr. Smith asked for more details about the headaches and the patient described them as throbbing pains around the temples and behind the eyes, often worse in the morning and sometimes lasting the entire day. The patient also mentioned accompanying symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to bright light. Dr. Smith inquired about any recent lifestyle changes and the patient admitted to increase work related stress and poor sleep, often getting only five hours of sleep a night. The doctor asked if the patient had a history of migraines or sinus issues and the patient confirmed occasional migraines in the past, usually triggered by certain foods, but noted that these current headaches felt different. Dr. Smith asked the patient to elaborate on his daily routine to better understand any potential contributing factors. The patient explained that he works in a high-pressure job, often staring at computer screens for long hours without taking sufficient breaks. He also mentioned a poor diet, relying on fast food and caffeine to get through the day and noted that exercise had fallen by the wayside due to his busy schedule. Dr. Smith noted thoughtfully taking notes and considering how these factors might be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient also mentioned trying a mirror front which provided limited relief and other measures like drinking more water and taking breaks during work, but nothing seemed to make a significant difference. Dr. Smith then performed a thorough physical examination. He checked the patient's blood pressure which was slightly elevated and measured his heart rate. He examined the patient's eye for any signs of strain or other issues and tested his reflexes and coordination to rule out any neurological problems. The doctor also palpated the patient's neck and shoulders, noting significant tension in these areas which could be contributing to the headaches. After the examination, Dr. Smith explained that the symptom could be due to several factors including stress, lack of sleep and possibly migraines. He suggested some initial steps such as improving hydration, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and trying relaxing techniques like deep breathing exercise, meditation or yoga. He also recommended that the patient keep a headache diary to track the frequency, duration and intensity of the headaches along with any potential triggers. Dr. Smith advised the patient to avoid known migraine triggers like certain foods and to try to manage stress through regular physical activity or mindfulness practices. Dr. Smith elaborated on the importance of a balanced diet, suggesting the patient incorporate more fruits, vegetables and whole grains and reduce the intake of caffeine and processed foods. Processed foods are too harmful for the body and caffeine will never ever get you sleep as early. So, he recommended the patient to set regular breaks during work to avoid prolonged sleep time and practice the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eyestrain. Dr. Smith suggested over-the-counter options like acetamiphone or naproxen as alternatives to ibuprofen and recommended the patient consider lifestyle changes such as reducing screen time before bed and creating a more restful sleep environment including keeping the bedroom cool and dark, avoiding screens for at least an hour before bedtime and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. Yes, that's good to hear. Yes. Dr. Smith discussed the possibility of using apps or wearable devices to monitor stress levels and encourage mindfulness and physical activity. He also mentioned that if the headaches persisted or worsened, prescription medications or referral to a neurologist for further evaluation might be necessary. The doctor reassured the patient that many people experience similar symptoms due to lifestyle factors and that making these changes could significantly improve high quality of life. Finally, Dr. Smith advised scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to monitor progress and discuss further tests or referrals to a specialist. If the headache persisted, he provided the patient with an educational pamphlet on stress management, sleep hygiene, and dietary changes. The patient thanked Dr. Smith for his thorough assessment and left the office feeling hopeful about managing his symptoms with the new strategies suggested and thanked for the same.";"2024-09-25 12:55:47";"124";"HONEY-001-HRTG"
"Good morning. It's nice to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last appointment? Good morning, doctor. I have been okay, I guess just a bit anxious about my seizures. They seem to be happening more frequently lately. I'm glad you are here to talk about it. Let's go over what's been happening. Can you tell me more about your recent seizures? When did they occur and how did you feel before and after? I had two last week. One during the day while I was at home and the other at night. I felt a little dizzy before the daytime one but I did not think much of it. I was just doing some chores. Afterward, I felt really exhausted and confused. That sounds difficult. It's not uncommon to feel fatigue after a seizure. Do you remember how long the seizure lasted and were there any witnesses who could describe what happened? The first one was probably a couple of minutes but I'm not really sure. My partner was home and said it lasted longer. They told me I was shaking and unresponsive. The second one at night I just woke up and feeling out of sorts. It's important to have someone there to monitor you during a seizure, especially if you are losing consciousness. Have you noticed any specific trigger that might be contributing to the increase in seizures? Well, I have been under a lot of stress at work. There have been some deadlines and I have not been sleeping well either. I think that could be playing a role. Stress and sleep deprivation can definitely be a significant factor. How's your sleep been? Are you managing to get enough rest? Not late, not really. I have been staying up late trying to finish work. Then I wake up early to get to the office. I know I should prioritize sleep but it's hard with everything going on. I understand it's a common challenge for many people. Sleep is crucial for overall health, especially when you have epilepsy. Let's talk about ways to improve your sleep hygiene. Have you tried any strategies to help you win down at night? I have tried some relaxation techniques but I often find myself scrolling through my phone instead of sleeping. It's easy to fall into that habit of reducing screen time before bed. It can help signal to your brain that it's time to weigh down. You might also try establishing a consistent bedtime routine. Something calming like reading or listening to soft music. That makes sense. I tried to put my phone away earlier. Great. Also, I want to make sure we are managing our medication effectively. Are you taking your anti-seizure medication as prescribed? Yes, I have been taking it every day. I have not missed a dose. But I wonder if I need a dosage adjustment since the seizures are more frequent. It's good to hear you are compliant with your medication. Sometimes as life changes, medication needs to change too. We can look into adjusting your dosage or trying a different medication if necessary. How has the current medication been affecting you? Any side effects? I feel a bit drowsy during the day but I thought that was just because of lack of sleep. It's hard to tell but sometimes drowsiness can indeed be a side effect to your medication. But it's also possible it's linked to your sleep issues. It might be helpful to monitor how you feel when you have had a good night's sleep versus when you have not. Could you be open to keeping a seizure diary? Like writing down when I have seizures and how I feel? In addition to tracking seizure occurrences, you can note your sleep patterns and stressors. Or how you felt physically and emotionally each day. This information can help us identify patterns and potential triggers. That sounds helpful. I can definitely do that. Excellent. We will review it at our next appointment. For now, I would like to make some adjustments to your medication regimen. I am considering increasing your dosage slightly. Well, we will need to monitor you closely for any changes. That makes sense. I would like to feel more stable. I am glad you are proactive about this. Also, given the increase in seizure frequency, I want to remind you about my safety precautions. Have you taken any steps to ensure your safety at home or work? I have been trying to avoid climbing ladders and driving. I just don't feel comfortable with the risk. That's a wise decision. Have you ever felt like you might have a seizure? It's crucial to avoid activities that put you in danger. Have you talked to your employer about your condition? I have not really opened up about it. I am worried about how they might react. It's understandable to feel apprehensive. But having a supportive work environment can be helpful. If you are comfortable, consider discussing with a trusted supervisor or HR representative. They might be able to offer accommodation to ease your stress. I'll think about it. I just don't want them to see me differently. It's a valid concern. Just remember epilepsy is a medical condition. Being open about it can foster understanding and support. You are right. I'll try to keep in mind. I'm glad to hear. Lastly, let's schedule an appointment in a month to review your diary and access how the medication adjusts. I appreciate your help, doctor. You are welcome. Remember, you are not alone in this. We are here to support you at every step of the way. Take care. I look forward to hearing how you are doing in our next visit. Thank you. See you next time.";"2024-09-25 12:54:29";"119";"AL0012"

"Good morning Alex, it's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last visit? Hi Dr. Martinez, I have been okay. I guess some days are really tough. I appreciate your honesty. It's normal to have ups and downs. Can you tell me about one of your tougher days? What made it difficult? Well, there was a day last week I could not stop hearing the voices. They were really loud and I felt like I was losing control. I'm sorry to hear that Alex. I must have been overwhelming. When the voices are loud, how do they affect you? They say things like I'm worthless and nobody cares about me. It's hard to ignore them. That sounds really painful. How do you usually cope when they become overwhelming? I try to distract myself, listen to music or watch TV but sometimes it doesn't work. It's good that you are finding ways to distract yourself. Have you noticed any specific trigger that makes the voices worse for you? Yeah, stress definitely makes it worse. Like when I go to family gatherings or when work gets busy. Family gatherings can be particularly challenging. How do you feel about attending those events? I love my family but I also feel anxious around them. They don't really understand what I'm going through and I don't want to scare them. It's understandable to feel that way. It can be difficult to share your experience especially when others may not fully grasp the complexity of schizophrenia. Can you share how your family typically reacts when you try to discuss your condition? They mean well but they often say things like just think positive or you will get over it. It feels dismissive. That must be frustrating for you. You deserve to be heard and understood. If you are comfortable, would you mind sharing a little more about your experience with the voices? What do they say and how often do you hear them? They can be pretty persistent especially when I'm alone. It varies but I hear them almost daily. Sometimes they talk about things from my past, bringing up mistakes I made. That sounds distressing. Revisiting past mistakes can be particularly hard. Are there specific memories that come up frequently? Yeah, like when I drop out of college I always feel I fail everyone including myself. Dropping out can weigh heavy on your mind. It's common to have regrets but I want you to know that your family is there for you. I want you to know that your worth is not defined by your academic achievements. Have you discussed your feelings about your college with anyone? Not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my issues. You are not a burden Alex. It's okay to share your feelings. Sometimes talking about these experiences can help lighten the load. Speaking of support, do you have friends or someone you trust who you can talk to? I have a couple of friends but I have been isolating myself lately. I feel embarrassed about the voices and I don't want to explain it to them. Isolation can be tough. It's natural to feel embarrassed but true friends will want to support you through difficult times. Would you be open to the idea of discussing your experiences with them? Maybe it's just hard to find the right words. It's understandable. Sometimes it helps to prepare what you want to say beforehand. You might find that your friends can provide a lot of support and understanding changing topics a bit. How have you been managing your medication? I have been taking it but I forgot sometimes, especially on days when I am feeling really down. Consistency is important for your treatment. Have you thought about using reminders like setting alarms on your phone and keeping a medication log? I could try that. I just get so caught up in everything that I forget. That's a great plan. It might help you feel more in control. Can I ask you more about your current living situation? How is it going for you? It's okay. I guess I live alone and sometimes feel lonely other times. I like the quiet. Living alone can have its pros and cons. When you are feeling isolated, do you have any strategies to reach out to others? Not really. I mostly just stay in my apartment. It feels safer that way. Safety is important but too much isolation can contribute to feeling worse perhaps. You can explore some small steps for you to connect with others even if it's just a text or a phone call. That might be good. I just need to work up the courage. It's okay to take small steps at your own pace. Every little effort counts. Also, have you been able to engage in any hobbies or activities that you enjoy? I used to love drawing but I have not done it much lately. When I am feeling low, it's hard to pick up a pencil. Art can be a wonderful outlet for expressing your feelings. Would you consider setting aside a little time each week to draw even if just for a few minutes? That might help. I used to feel so relaxed when I draw. That's great to hear. Finding activities can bring you joy and can really help with managing symptoms. Before we wrap up, I want to revisit something we discussed earlier. Have you felt about scheduling next appointment? It's important to keep up our work together. I would like that it helps to talk things through with you. I am glad you feel that way, Alex. Remember, you are not alone with this. We are in this together and I am here to support you every step of the way. Thank you, Dr. Martinez. That means a lot to me. Thank you.";"2024-09-25 11:36:35";"123";"MR-98012"

"Dr. Lee, Recording Patient Consultation, September 3, 2024. Today, Ms. Thompson presented with several concerning symptoms. She reported experiencing persistent headaches over the past two weeks, which typically begin in the afternoon and can become quite severe. The headaches are described as a dull ache with occasional throbbing, especially around the temples. Despite using over-the-counter pain relievers, she has experienced only minimal relief. In addition to headaches, Ms. Thompson has been dealing with constant fatigue throughout the day, which impacts her daily functioning. She also reports feeling nauseous, with symptoms being particularly pronounced in the mornings, especially if she has not eaten sufficiently. Alongside nausea, she experiences lightheadedness. Ms. Thompson noted an increased sensitivity to light during headache episodes and mentioned having difficulty falling asleep. She frequently wakes up during the night and feels unrested despite adequate sleep duration. Upon discussing her recent lifestyle changes, Ms. Thompson revealed significant work-related stress and extended working hours. She has also noted a decrease in her usual exercise routine and has not been maintaining a balanced diet, as she usually does. In summary, Ms. Thompson's symptoms include persistent headaches, fatigue, nausea, and lightheadedness, with an additional factor of poor sleep quality. These issues seem to be compounded by recent stress and changes in her daily routine. Further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying causes and appropriate management strategies.";"2024-09-25 11:30:20";"123";"MR-98012"
"Good morning Mr. Davis, how are you feeling today? Good morning doctor, honestly I am feeling a bit run down, the cough has gotten worse and I am having night sweats that keep me awake. I am sorry to hear that, let's go over your symptoms, how long has the cough been bothering you and have you noticed any other symptoms? It's been going on about 2 months now, it started as a dry cough but now it's quite persistent. I have also been sweating a lot at night and feeling more tired than usual, I have lost some weight too which worries me. Those are significant symptoms, it sounds like you might be dealing with tuberculosis or TB, we will need to run some tests to confirm this, in the meantime have you been managing at home? I have been trying to take it easy and stay hydrated, I have also been using the over the counter cough medicine but it doesn't seem to help much. It's been tough especially with the kids running around, I can imagine managing symptoms while keeping up with family life can be challenging, how is your family members handling everything? They are doing their best, my wife has been a rock through all this, managing the house and taking care of me, my kids are young so they don't fully understand but they are trying to be supportive. It's great that you have such a supportive family, have a good support system can make a big difference, how are you explaining things to your kids? We are keeping it simple, we tell them that I am sick and need to rest to get better, my wife is good at reassuring them and keeping their routines normal, that's a smart approach. If you ever need more guidance on how to talk to them or resources for support, just let me know, I am here to help. Thanks doctor, it might take you up on that and speaking of support, I am missing out on a lot of my regular activities, I used to play a local soccer league but I have had to stop, I understand how frustrating that can be, it's tough to give up activities you enjoy, soccer sounds like it was a big part of your routine. How long have you been playing? I have been playing since college, it's always been a great way for me to unwind and stay fit, not being able to play right now is one of the hardest part of this illness. I see, why that would be difficult getting back to the things you love is important for your overall well-being, once you have your TB diagnosis confirmed and you start treatment, you will need to rest and avoid strenuous activities for a while but hopefully you will be available to get back on the field sooner rather than later. I really hope so, I miss the camera diary with my teammates and the thrill of the game, do you think I will be able to return to playing once I am better? Absolutely, with the right treatment, once you are fully recovered, you should be able to return to playing, it's important to follow the treatment plan closely and give yourself time to heal properly, it's great that you have something to look forward to, I am counting on it, what kind of treatment should I expect? TB treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and you will need to take for about 6-9 months, it's crucial to take all your medication as prescribed to fully eliminate the bacteria and prevent development of drug resistant TB, 6-9 months sounds like a long time but I understand the importance, will I need to stay in the hospital during this time? Not necessary, most people with TB can be treated on an outpatient basis, you will need regular checkup to monitor your progress but hospitalization is generally only needed if there are complications or if the disease is more severe, that's good to hear, I had much rather to be at home with my family, I am also worried about my treatment, how my treatment will affect them, it's understandable to be concerned, you will need to follow precautions to prevent spreading TB such as covering your mouth, when you cough and ventilating your living space, using a mask can also help, your family should be fine as long as you follow these precautions and complete your treatment, I will make sure to do that, I don't want to put them at risk, by the way, how are you holding up doctor? It must be quite a job keeping track of all your patients, I appreciate you asking, it can be busy but it's rewarding to help people through their health challenges, I enjoy hearing about my parents living, lives and interests, it helps me understand their situation better, that's nice to hear, it's been comforting to talk with you, do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work? I do, I enjoy gardening and reading, it's a nice way to unwind after a busy day, do you have any favorite activities or hobbies besides soccer? I used to enjoy woodworking as a hobby, I have not had much time for it lately but I had love to get back into it once I'm feeling better, woodworking sounds like a fantastic and rewarding hobby, it's great to have creative outlets, once you are back on your feet, you will have plenty of time to dive back into it, in the meantime, if you need anything or just want to chat about soccer or woodworking, feel free to reach out, I'll keep that in mind, it's nice to have a doctor who takes the time to listen and engage, thanks for making this process a bit easier for me, you're welcome Mr. Davis, I'm here to support you through this, let's get those tests scheduled and I'll follow up with you once we have the results, we'll work together to get you back to feeling your best, sounds like a plan, that's again, thanks again doctor, I'll see you soon for the test, looking forward to it, take care Mr. Davis and remember you are not alone in this, thanks doctor, I appreciate it.";"2024-09-25 11:21:15";"123";"MR-98012"
"Diksha, a 27 year old girl, Diksha explained that she had been experiencing persistent headaches and occasional dizziness for the past couple of weeks, which was starting to interfere with her daily activities. So Dr. Smith asked for more details about the headaches and the patient described them as throbbing pains around the temples and behind the eyes, often worse in the morning and sometimes lasting the entire day. The patient also mentioned accompanying symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to bright light. Dr. Smith inquired about any recent lifestyle changes and the patient admitted to increase work related stress and poor sleep, often getting only five hours of sleep a night. The doctor asked if the patient had a history of migraines or sinus issues and the patient confirmed occasional migraines in the past, usually triggered by certain foods, but noted that these current headaches felt different. Dr. Smith asked the patient to elaborate on his daily routine to better understand any potential contributing factors. The patient explained that he works in a high-pressure job, often staring at computer screens for long hours without taking sufficient breaks. He also mentioned a poor diet, relying on fast food and caffeine to get through the day and noted that exercise had fallen by the wayside due to his busy schedule. Dr. Smith noted thoughtfully taking notes and considering how these factors might be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient also mentioned trying a mirror front which provided limited relief and other measures like drinking more water and taking breaks during work, but nothing seemed to make a significant difference. Dr. Smith then performed a thorough physical examination. He checked the patient's blood pressure which was slightly elevated and measured his heart rate. He examined the patient's eye for any signs of strain or other issues and tested his reflexes and coordination to rule out any neurological problems. The doctor also palpated the patient's neck and shoulders, noting significant tension in these areas which could be contributing to the headaches. After the examination, Dr. Smith explained that the symptom could be due to several factors including stress, lack of sleep and possibly migraines. He suggested some initial steps such as improving hydration, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and trying relaxing techniques like deep breathing exercise, meditation or yoga. He also recommended that the patient keep a headache diary to track the frequency, duration and intensity of the headaches along with any potential triggers. Dr. Smith advised the patient to avoid known migraine triggers like certain foods and to try to manage stress through regular physical activity or mindfulness practices. Dr. Smith elaborated on the importance of a balanced diet, suggesting the patient incorporate more fruits, vegetables and whole grains and reduce the intake of caffeine and processed foods. Processed foods are too harmful for the body and caffeine will never ever get you sleep as early. So, he recommended the patient to set regular breaks during work to avoid prolonged sleep time and practice the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eyestrain. Dr. Smith suggested over-the-counter options like acetamiphone or naproxen as alternatives to ibuprofen and recommended the patient consider lifestyle changes such as reducing screen time before bed and creating a more restful sleep environment including keeping the bedroom cool and dark, avoiding screens for at least an hour before bedtime and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. Yes, that's good to hear. Yes. Dr. Smith discussed the possibility of using apps or wearable devices to monitor stress levels and encourage mindfulness and physical activity. He also mentioned that if the headaches persisted or worsened, prescription medications or referral to a neurologist for further evaluation might be necessary. The doctor reassured the patient that many people experience similar symptoms due to lifestyle factors. And that making these changes could significantly improve high quality of life. Finally, Dr. Smith advised scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to monitor progress and discuss further tests or referrals to a specialist if the headache persisted. He provided the patient with an educational pamphlet on stress management, sleep hygiene, and dietary changes. The patient thanked Dr. Smith for his thorough assessment and left the office feeling hopeful about managing his symptoms with the new strategies suggested and thanked for the same.";"2024-09-25 11:06:02";"124";"HONEY-001-HRTG"
"Good morning, how are you feeling today? Good morning, doctor. Honestly, I'm not feeling too great. I have been having a high fever and I'm really weak. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me when the symptoms started and how they have been progressing? It started about four days ago with a mild fever, but it's gotten worse. I have had high fever, severe headaches, joint pain and my body feels achy. I'm also feeling nauseous and I have been vomiting quite a bit. It sounds like you are going through a rough time. Have you had any rashes or bleeding issues like bleeding gums or nosebleeds? I have not had any bleeding, but I had noticed a rash developing yesterday. It's not too severe, just a bit of redness and small spots on my arms and legs. That's useful information based on your symptoms and the rash. Dengue fever is something we need to consider. Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause severe flu-like symptoms. Have you had any recent mosquito bites or travelled to areas known for dengue outbreaks? Yes, I did travel to a region where dengue is common about two weeks ago. I have been bitten by mosquitoes there and I did not really think much of it at that time. That's an important detail. Dengue fever usually has an incubation period of about 4-10 days. So, it makes sense that your symptoms have developed now. We need to do some tests to confirm it. If it's dengue and to assess the severity of your condition, what kind of tests will you be doing? We will start with a blood test to check for the presence of dengue virus or antibodies. We will also access your blood cell counts, especially your platelet levels as dengue can affect these. Additionally, we might need to do some tests to monitor your liver. and kidney function to see if there are any complications. That sounds thorough. I am a bit worried about my condition. What should I expect if it is dengue? It's understandable to be concerned dengue can range from mild to severe. Most cases are mild and involve symptoms like high fever, pain and rash which usually involve on their own with proper care. However, in severe cases, it can lead to dengue, hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome which require more intense treatment and monitoring. What are the signs of severe dengue that I should watch out for? Severe dengue can persist with more serious symptoms such as persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, blood bleeding, gums, difficulty breathing and a significant drop in blood pressure. If you notice any of these symptoms, you need to seek medical help immediately. I'll keep an eye on that. How do you manage dengue fever? For most people, the management includes plenty of fresh fluids to stay hydrated and medications to manage symptoms like fever and pain. We usually advise avoiding medications like aspirin or non-stereotype anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs because they can increase the risk of bleeding. Is there anything specific I should eat or avoid? It's important to stay hydrated. So, drink plenty of fluids like water, oral rehydration solution or clear soups. Eating light and easily digestible food can also help if you are having nausea. Avoid oily and spicy food might be a good idea if your stomach is upset. What about my activity levels? Should I rest completely? Yes, rest is crucial. Avoid strenuous activities and ensure you get adequate sleep. Your body needs energy to fight off the infection to try to take it easy. How long will it take for me to start feeling better? Most people start feeling better within a week to 10 days. However, recovery can vary from person to person. It's important to follow up on your condition and adhere to any recommendations or treatment provided. I'll make sure to follow up your advice. How often should I come in for checkups? Initially, we need to monitor your condition closely. So, I would recommend coming in for follow-up visits every couple of days to track your progress. Once your symptoms start improving and your test results are more stable, we can adjust the frequency of visits. I appreciate your help and guidance, doctor. I'm a bit anxious now. But to expect your welcome, it's completely normal to feel anxious. But remember that we are here to support you through this. If you have any questions or concerns, in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you. I'll definitely keep in touch and follow your recommendations. Good. I'm glad to hear that. Make sure to take care of yourself. I'll see you at our next appointment. We'll do thanks again for everything. You're welcome. Take care and see you soon. Goodbye, doctor.

"Dr. Good Morning, Karen. I understand you're here because of a leg injury. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened? Karen. Good morning, Dr. Yes. I hurt my leg last week. I was playing soccer with friends and I twisted my leg awkwardly while trying to change direction. Quickly. It felt like something pulled or strained. Since then, it's been swollen and painful. Dr. I see. Can you describe the pain for me? Is it sharp, dull, throbbing, or aching? Karen. It's mostly a dull ache, but it gets sharper when I try to move or put weight on it. The pain is concentrated around my ankle and the lower part of my leg. Dr. How would you rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable? Karen. On most days, it's around a 5 or 6. It spikes up to 8 or 9 if I try to walk or stand for too long. Dr. Have you noticed any swelling, bruising, or changes in color in your leg? Karen. Yes, there's definitely swelling, and it's a bit bruised around the ankle. The bruising seems to be getting worse, and it's hard to move my foot properly. Dr. Have you tried any treatments or home remedies so far? Karen. I've been icing it and keeping it elevated. I've also taken some over-the-counter painkillers, but they only help a little. Dr. Have you had any other symptoms like fever or numbness in the leg? Karen. No fever, but sometimes it feels like my leg is a bit numb, especially after I've been sitting for a while. Objective. Dr. Alright, let me examine your leg now. I'm going to check for any visible signs of injury and assess the range of motion. Doctor performs a physical examination, inspecting the leg for swelling, bruising, and tenderness. The doctor also palpates the area and assesses the range of motion in the ankle and lower leg. Doctor. From what I can see, there is significant swelling around the ankle, and there is some bruising. The range of motion is limited, especially in terms of dorsiflexion. There's noticeable tenderness over the lateral aspect of the ankle. Assessment. Doctor. Based on your description and my examination, it looks like you might have a sprain, possibly a grade 2 sprain, given the level of swelling and pain. A grade 2 sprain involves partial tearing of the ligaments, and it would explain the tenderness, swelling, and bruising you're experiencing. Karen. That sounds about right. I was worried it might be something more serious. Doctor. It's good you came in for a proper assessment. We should also consider getting an x-ray to rule out any fractures or significant damage to the bones, as sometimes fractures can present with similar symptoms. Karen. That makes sense. I'd prefer to make sure it's nothing more severe. Plan. Doctor. Here's what we'll do. Order x-rays to rule out fractures and confirm the extent of ligament injury. Rest and elevation. Continue to keep the leg elevated and avoid putting weight on it as much as possible. Ice therapy. Apply ice packs to reduce swelling and numb the area. Do this for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for the first 48 hours. Pain management. Continue with over-the-counter pain medication, but if the pain becomes unmanageable, let me know, and we might consider a stronger prescription. Compression. Use an elastic bandage to compress the injured area, which can help control swelling. Follow-up. I'd like to see you back here in a week to check on your progress and review the x-ray results. Karen. Thank you. Doctor. I'll get the x-ray done today and follow your instructions. Doctor. Great. If. You notice any worsening symptoms, such as increased pain, significant changes in color, or if. You're unable to move your toes, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, we'll review. Everything next week and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Karen. I'll keep an eye on it. Thanks for your help. Doctor. You're welcome. Karen. I hope you start feeling better soon. Take. Care and follow the plan. See you next week.";"2024-09-25 11:00:23";"124";"HONEY-001-HRTG"

"Dr. Lee, Recording Patient Consultation, September 3, 2024. Today, Ms. Thompson presented with several concerning symptoms. She reported experiencing persistent headaches over the past two weeks, which typically begin in the afternoon and can become quite severe. The headaches are described as a dull ache with occasional throbbing, especially around the temples. Despite using over-the-counter pain relievers, she has experienced only minimal relief. In addition to headaches, Ms. Thompson has been dealing with constant fatigue throughout the day, which impacts her daily functioning. She also reports feeling nauseous, with symptoms being particularly pronounced in the mornings, especially if she has not eaten sufficiently. Alongside nausea, she experiences lightheadedness. Ms. Thompson noted an increased sensitivity to light during headache episodes and mentioned having difficulty falling asleep. She frequently wakes up during the night and feels unrested despite adequate sleep duration. Upon discussing her recent lifestyle changes, Ms. Thompson revealed significant work-related stress and extended working hours. She has also noted a decrease in her usual exercise routine and has not been maintaining a balanced diet, as she usually does. In summary, Ms. Thompson's symptoms include persistent headaches, fatigue, nausea, and lightheadedness, with an additional factor of poor sleep quality. These issues seem to be compounded by recent stress and changes in her daily routine. Further investigation is warranted to determine the underlying causes and appropriate management strategies.";"2024-09-25 10:51:02";"123";"MR-98012"

"Diksha, a 27 year old girl, Diksha explained that she had been experiencing persistent headaches and occasional dizziness for the past couple of weeks, which was starting to interfere with her daily activities. So Dr. Smith asked for more details about the headaches and the patient described them as throbbing pains around the temples and behind the eyes, often worse in the morning and sometimes lasting the entire day. The patient also mentioned accompanying symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to bright light. Dr. Smith inquired about any recent lifestyle changes and the patient admitted to increase work related stress and poor sleep, often getting only five hours of sleep a night. The doctor asked if the patient had a history of migraines or sinus issues and the patient confirmed occasional migraines in the past, usually triggered by certain foods, but noted that these current headaches felt different. Dr. Smith asked the patient to elaborate on his daily routine to better understand any potential contributing factors. The patient explained that he works in a high-pressure job, often staring at computer screens for long hours without taking sufficient breaks. He also mentioned a poor diet, relying on fast food and caffeine to get through the day and noted that exercise had fallen by the wayside due to his busy schedule. Dr. Smith noted thoughtfully taking notes and considering how these factors might be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient also mentioned trying a mirror front which provided limited relief and other measures like drinking more water and taking breaks during work, but nothing seemed to make a significant difference. Dr. Smith then performed a thorough physical examination. He checked the patient's blood pressure which was slightly elevated and measured his heart rate. He examined the patient's eye for any signs of strain or other issues and tested his reflexes and coordination to rule out any neurological problems. The doctor also palpated the patient's neck and shoulders, noting significant tension in these areas which could be contributing to the headaches. After the examination, Dr. Smith explained that the symptom could be due to several factors including stress, lack of sleep and possibly migraines. He suggested some initial steps such as improving hydration, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and trying relaxing techniques like deep breathing exercise, meditation or yoga. He also recommended that the patient keep a headache diary to track the frequency, duration and intensity of the headaches along with any potential triggers. Dr. Smith advised the patient to avoid known migraine triggers like certain foods and to try to manage stress through regular physical activity or mindfulness practices. Dr. Smith elaborated on the importance of a balanced diet, suggesting the patient incorporate more fruits, vegetables and whole grains and reduce the intake of caffeine and processed foods. Processed foods are too harmful for the body and caffeine will never ever get you sleep as early. So, he recommended the patient to set regular breaks during work to avoid prolonged sleep time and practice the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eyestrain. Dr. Smith suggested over-the-counter options like acetamiphone or naproxen as alternatives to ibuprofen and recommended the patient consider lifestyle changes such as reducing screen time before bed and creating a more restful sleep environment including keeping the bedroom cool and dark, avoiding screens for at least an hour before bedtime and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. Yes, that's good to hear. Yes. Dr. Smith discussed the possibility of using apps or wearable devices to monitor stress levels and encourage mindfulness and physical activity. He also mentioned that if the headaches persisted or worsened, prescription medications or referral to a neurologist for further evaluation might be necessary. The doctor reassured the patient that many people experience similar symptoms due to lifestyle factors and that making these changes could significantly improve high quality of life. Finally, Dr. Smith advised scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to monitor progress and discuss further tests or referrals to a specialist. If the headache persisted, he provided the patient with an educational pamphlet on stress management, sleep hygiene, and dietary changes. The patient thanked Dr. Smith for his thorough assessment and left the office feeling hopeful about managing his symptoms with the new strategies suggested and thanked for the same.";"2024-09-25 10:49:17";"116";"SEP-24"
"Good morning Mr. Davis, how are you feeling today? Good morning doctor, honestly I am feeling a bit run down, the cough has gotten worse and I am having night sweats that keep me awake. I am sorry to hear that, let's go over your symptoms, how long has the cough been bothering you and have you noticed any other symptoms? It's been going on about 2 months now, it started as a dry cough but now it's quite persistent. I have also been sweating a lot at night and feeling more tired than usual, I have lost some weight too which worries me. Those are significant symptoms, it sounds like you might be dealing with tuberculosis or TB, we will need to run some tests to confirm this, in the meantime have you been managing at home? I have been trying to take it easy and stay hydrated, I have also been using the over the counter cough medicine but it doesn't seem to help much. It's been tough especially with the kids running around, I can imagine managing symptoms while keeping up with family life can be challenging, how is your family members handling everything? They are doing their best, my wife has been a rock through all this, managing the house and taking care of me, my kids are young so they don't fully understand but they are trying to be supportive. It's great that you have such a supportive family, have a good support system can make a big difference, how are you explaining things to your kids? We are keeping it simple, we tell them that I am sick and need to rest to get better, my wife is good at reassuring them and keeping their routines normal, that's a smart approach. If you ever need more guidance on how to talk to them or resources for support, just let me know, I am here to help. Thanks doctor, it might take you up on that and speaking of support, I am missing out on a lot of my regular activities, I used to play a local soccer league but I have had to stop, I understand how frustrating that can be, it's tough to give up activities you enjoy, soccer sounds like it was a big part of your routine. How long have you been playing? I have been playing since college, it's always been a great way for me to unwind and stay fit, not being able to play right now is one of the hardest part of this illness. I see, why that would be difficult getting back to the things you love is important for your overall well-being, once you have your TB diagnosis confirmed and you start treatment, you will need to rest and avoid strenuous activities for a while but hopefully you will be available to get back on the field sooner rather than later. I really hope so, I miss the camera diary with my teammates and the thrill of the game, do you think I will be able to return to playing once I am better? Absolutely, with the right treatment, once you are fully recovered, you should be able to return to playing, it's important to follow the treatment plan closely and give yourself time to heal properly, it's great that you have something to look forward to, I am counting on it, what kind of treatment should I expect? TB treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and you will need to take for about 6-9 months, it's crucial to take all your medication as prescribed to fully eliminate the bacteria and prevent development of drug resistant TB, 6-9 months sounds like a long time but I understand the importance, will I need to stay in the hospital during this time? Not necessary, most people with TB can be treated on an outpatient basis, you will need regular checkup to monitor your progress but hospitalization is generally only needed if there are complications or if the disease is more severe, that's good to hear, I had much rather to be at home with my family, I am also worried about my treatment, how my treatment will affect them, it's understandable to be concerned, you will need to follow precautions to prevent spreading TB such as covering your mouth, when you cough and ventilating your living space, using a mask can also help, your family should be fine as long as you follow these precautions and complete your treatment, I will make sure to do that, I don't want to put them at risk, by the way, how are you holding up doctor? It must be quite a job keeping track of all your patients, I appreciate you asking, it can be busy but it's rewarding to help people through their health challenges, I enjoy hearing about my parents living, lives and interests, it helps me understand their situation better, that's nice to hear, it's been comforting to talk with you, do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work? I do, I enjoy gardening and reading, it's a nice way to unwind after a busy day, do you have any favorite activities or hobbies besides soccer? I used to enjoy woodworking as a hobby, I have not had much time for it lately but I had love to get back into it once I'm feeling better, woodworking sounds like a fantastic and rewarding hobby, it's great to have creative outlets, once you are back on your feet, you will have plenty of time to dive back into it, in the meantime, if you need anything or just want to chat about soccer or woodworking, feel free to reach out, I'll keep that in mind, it's nice to have a doctor who takes the time to listen and engage, thanks for making this process a bit easier for me, you're welcome Mr. Davis, I'm here to support you through this, let's get those tests scheduled and I'll follow up with you once we have the results, we'll work together to get you back to feeling your best, sounds like a plan, that's again, thanks again doctor, I'll see you soon for the test, looking forward to it, take care Mr. Davis and remember you are not alone in this, thanks doctor, I appreciate it.";"2024-09-25 10:45:53";"123";"MR-98012"

"Good morning, how are you feeling today? Good morning, doctor. Honestly, I'm not feeling too great. I have been having a high fever and I'm really weak. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me when the symptoms started and how they have been progressing? It started about four days ago with a mild fever, but it's gotten worse. I have had high fever, severe headaches, joint pain and my body feels achy. I'm also feeling nauseous and I have been vomiting quite a bit. It sounds like you are going through a rough time. Have you had any rashes or bleeding issues like bleeding gums or nosebleeds? I have not had any bleeding, but I had noticed a rash developing yesterday. It's not too severe, just a bit of redness and small spots on my arms and legs. That's useful information based on your symptoms and the rash. Dengue fever is something we need to consider. Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause severe flu-like symptoms. Have you had any recent mosquito bites or travelled to areas known for dengue outbreaks? Yes, I did travel to a region where dengue is common about two weeks ago. I have been bitten by mosquitoes there and I did not really think much of it at that time. That's an important detail. Dengue fever usually has an incubation period of about 4-10 days. So, it makes sense that your symptoms have developed now. We need to do some tests to confirm it. If it's dengue and to assess the severity of your condition, what kind of tests will you be doing? We will start with a blood test to check for the presence of dengue virus or antibodies. We will also access your blood cell counts, especially your platelet levels as dengue can affect these. Additionally, we might need to do some tests to monitor your liver. and kidney function to see if there are any complications. That sounds thorough. I am a bit worried about my condition. What should I expect if it is dengue? It's understandable to be concerned that dengue can range from mild to severe. Most cases are mild and involve symptoms like high fever, pain and rash which usually involve on their own with proper care. However, in severe cases, it can lead to dengue, hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome which require more intense treatment and monitoring. What are the signs of severe dengue that I should watch out for? Severe dengue can persist with more serious symptoms such as persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, blood bleeding, gums, difficulty breathing and a significant drop in blood pressure. If you notice any of these symptoms, you need to seek medical help immediately. I'll keep an eye on that. How do you manage dengue fever? For most people, the management includes plenty of fresh fluids to stay hydrated and medications to manage symptoms like fever and pain. We usually advise avoiding medications like aspirin or non-stereotype anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs because they can increase the risk of bleeding. Is there anything specific I should eat or avoid? It's important to stay hydrated. So, drink plenty of fluids like water, oral rehydration solution or clear soups. Eating light and easily digestible food can also help if you are having nausea. Avoid oily and spicy food might be a good idea if your stomach is upset. What about my activity levels? Should I rest completely? Yes, rest is crucial. Avoid strenuous activities and ensure you get adequate sleep. Your body needs energy to fight off the infection to try to take it easy. How long will it take for me to start feeling better? Most people start feeling better within a week to 10 days. However, recovery can vary from person to person. It's important to follow up on your condition and adhere to any recommendations or treatment provided. I'll make sure to follow up your advice. How often should I come in for checkups? Initially, we need to monitor your condition closely. So, I would recommend coming in for follow-up visits every couple of days to track your progress. Once your symptoms start improving and your test results are more stable, we can adjust the frequency of visits. I appreciate your help and guidance, doctor. I'm a bit anxious now. But to expect your welcome, it's completely normal to feel anxious. But remember that we are here to support you through this. If you have any questions or concerns, in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you. I'll definitely keep in touch and follow your recommendations. Good. I'm glad to hear that. Make sure to take care of yourself. I'll see you at our next appointment. We'll do thanks again for everything. You're welcome. Take care and see you soon. Goodbye, doctor.

"Start. Good morning Mr. Johnson. It's great to see you again. How have you been? Oh hey Dr. Smith. Uh, I've been better to be very honest. I am sorry to hear that. Before we dive into what's bothering you, how's that garden of yours coming along? Last time we talked, you were excited about your tomatoes. Oh the garden. It's actually doing pretty well. The tomatoes are ripening nicely. You should see them. They're huge. That's fantastic. I might have to stop by for some fresh produce one of these days. Now, what seems to be the issue today? Well Doc, I've been having these, uh, weird symptoms. It's hard to explain. Take your time Mr. Johnson. I'm here to listen. Okay, so I've been feeling really tired lately. Like, exhausted all the time. And I've lost some weight without trying. I see. How long has this been going on? Uh, I'd say about three months now. Have you noticed any other changes or symptoms? Yeah, actually I've been sweating a lot at night. And I've this persistent cough that won't go away. I see. That does sound concerning. Let's dive a bit deeper into your symptoms and medical history. Have you had any fevers? Now that you mention it, yeah. I've had some low-grade fevers on and off. Okay, and how about your appetite? Any changes there? It's not great. I don't feel like eating much these days. I understand now. Let's talk about your medical history. Any chronic conditions we should be aware of? Well, you know about my high blood pressure. Oh, and I had that bout of pneumonia last year. Oh yes, I remember. How about your family history? Any significant illnesses? My dad had lung cancer and my mom has diabetes. I see. Thank you for sharing that. Now, let's talk about your lifestyle. Are you still smoking? Uh, yeah. I know I should quit, dog. I understand. It's difficult. But quitting would significantly improve your health. We can discuss some strategies later. But how about alcohol consumption? Just a beer or two on weekends. Alright, now given your symptoms and history, I think we need to run some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. Oh boy, what kind of tests are we talking about? Well, we'll start with some blood work to check for any abnormalities. I'd also like to get a chest x-ray and possibly a CT scan. Wow, that sounds serious. It's important to be thorough, Mr. Johnson. We want to rule out any serious conditions and get to the bottom of your symptoms. I understand. What are you thinking it might be? Well, there are several possibilities we need to consider. Given your symptoms, the fatigue, weight loss, night sweats and persistent cough, we need to rule out conditions like tuberculosis, lymphoma or even lung cancer. But let's not jump to conclusions before we have the test results. Cancer? Oh man, that's scary. I know, it sounds frightening. But remember, we are just being cautious and thorough. It could also be something less serious like an autoimmune disorder or a chronic infection. That's why we need these tests. Okay, Doc, I trust you. What's next? Here's what we are going to do. First, we'll get your blood work done today. I'll also schedule you for a chest x-ray this week. Once we have those results, we'll decide if we need further imaging like a CT scan. All right. And how long will it take to get the results? The blood work should be back in a couple of days. The x-ray results we can usually get within 24 hours. I'll call you as soon as I have them. Okay. And what about, you know, while we're waiting? Great question. For now, I want you to rest as much as possible. Stay hydrated and try to eat nutritious meals, even if you don't have much appetite. If your fever spikes or you develop any new symptoms, call me immediately. Got it. Anything else I should do or avoid? Yes, actually, it's crucial that you avoid smoking as much as possible. I know it's hard, but it could make a significant difference in your symptoms and overall health. I'll try my best, doc. I appreciate that, Mr. Johnson. Now, do you have any other questions or concerns? I guess I'm just worried, you know. That's completely understandable. It's natural to feel anxious and when facing health uncertainties. But remember, we are partners in this. We'll figure it out together, okay? Thanks, doc. That means a lot. You're welcome. Oh, before I forget, how is your daughter doing? She was preparing for her college exams last time we spoke. Oh, she's doing great. She's actually got accepted to her top choice. That's wonderful news. Congratulations to her. You must be very proud. I really am. Thanks for remembering, doc. Of course. It's always a pleasure to hear good news. Now, let's get you set up for those tests. The nurse will be in shortly to draw your blood and I'll see you again once we have the results. Sounds good, doc. Thanks for everything. You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Take care and don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Before you go, Mr. Johnson, I'd like to prescribe some medications to help manage your symptoms while we wait for the test results. Okay. What kind of medications are we talking about? Well, first I'm going to prescribe an inhaler to help with your cough and any potential breathing difficulties. It's called Albuterol. An inhaler? I've never used one before. Don't worry. It's quite simple to use. The pharmacist will demonstrate to you how to use it and give you a prescription. The pharmacist will demonstrate how to use it properly. You'll need to take two puffs every four to six hours as needed. All right. I think I can manage that. Good. Now, for your fever and any discomfort, I'm prescribing acetaminophen. It's an over-the-counter medication, but I want you to take it regularly. Is that like Tylenol? Exactly. Take 650 mg every six hours. This should help with the fever and any pain you might be experiencing. Got it. Anything else? Yes. I'm also prescribing a cough suppressant with choline. It's called Uvefinacin with choline. This should help with your persistent cough, especially at night. Oh, that sounds good. The cough has been keeping me up all night. I understand. Take 10 ml of the syrup every four to six hours as needed, but be careful. It might make you drowsy, so you don't drive after taking it. Noted. Any side effects I should know about? Good question. The most common side effects for these medications include dizziness, dry mouth, and mild nausea. If you experience any severe side effects or allergic reactions, stop taking the medication and call me immediately. Okay. I'll keep an eye out for that for sure. Now, I also want to address your nutrition. Given your reduced appetite, I am recommending a high-calorie, high-protein nutritional shake. You can get these over the counter. Try to drink one or two a day between meals. That sounds doable. Excellent. Oh, and one more thing. I'm prescribing a nicotine patch to help with your smoking cessation efforts. Oh boy, I guess it's time, huh? It really is, Mr. Johnson. The patch will help manage your cravings. Start with a 21 mg patch and wear it for 24 hours. We'll gradually reduce the dosage over time. All right, Doc. I'll give it a shot. I'm proud of you for taking this step. Now, let's recap your treatment plan. Albuterol inhaler, 2 puffs every 4 to 6 hours as needed. Acetaminophen, 650 mg every 6 hours. We're finishing with codeine, 10 ml, 4 to 6 hours as needed. Nutritional shakes, 1 to 2 per day between meals. Nicotine patch, 21 mg, worn for 24 hours. Do you have any questions about these medications or the treatment plan? Um, I think I got it all. But what about side effects if I take all of these together? That's a great question. These medications are generally safe to take together. But it's important to follow the dosage instructions carefully. The main thing to watch out for is increased drowsiness, especially when you take the coxswirl. If you feel excessively drowsy, let me know and we can adjust the dosages. Okay, that makes sense. And how long will I need to take these? For now, let's plan on two weeks. By then, we should have all your test results and a clearer picture of what's going on. We'll reassess your medications at your follow-up appointment. Two weeks, got it. Oh, one more thing. Is it okay if I still work on my garden? Light gardening should be fine, Mr. Johnson. In fact, some gentle activity can be beneficial. Just make sure you don't overexert yourself. Stay hydrated and take breaks when you feel tired. That's a relief. Gardening really helps me, you know, takes my mind off things. I completely understand. It's great stress reliever. Just remember to wear a mask if you are dealing with soil or compost as a precaution. Will do, doc. Thanks for everything. You're welcome, Mr. Johnson. Remember, if you have any concerns or if your symptoms worsen, don't hesitate to call me. We are in this together. I really appreciate that, doc. I'll see you in two weeks, right? That's right. Take care and good luck with those tomatoes. Thanks, doc. I might save you a few if they turn out good. I look forward to that. Take care, Mr. Johnson.";"2024-09-25 09:23:46";"120";"DV001"
"Patient. Good morning, doctor. I've been having some issues with my back lately, and it's starting to interfere with my daily activities. I was hoping you could help me figure out what's going on. Doctor. Good morning. I'm sorry to hear you've been dealing with back pain. Let's start by discussing your symptoms in more detail. When did the pain begin, and can you describe what it feels like? Patient. The pain started about three weeks ago. It began as a dull ache in my lower back, but over the past week, it's become sharper and more intense, especially when I bend over or lift something heavy. It's mostly in my lower back, but sometimes I feel it shooting down my left leg. Doctor. It sounds like you're experiencing sciatica, which is pain that radiates along the path of the sciatic nerve, typically starting in the lower back and traveling down the leg. Sciatica is often caused by a herniated disc or a bone spur compressing the nerve. Have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness in your leg? Patient. Yes, I have. Sometimes my leg feels tingly, and I've noticed that it's weaker than usual, especially when I'm trying to stand up from a sitting position. It's really affecting my ability to move around. Doctor. That's definitely concerning. Sciatica can be quite painful and debilitating. Let's talk about any activities or incidents that might have triggered this pain. Did you lift something heavy or twist your back awkwardly before the pain started? Patient. I think it might have started after I helped a friend move some furniture. I didn't feel anything at the time, but the next day, my back was really sore. I thought it would go away with rest, but it's just gotten worse. Doctor. Lifting heavy objects, especially without proper form, can put a lot of strain on the lower back and lead to injuries like muscle strains, herniated discs, or even ligament damage. It's possible that lifting the furniture caused a disc in your lower back to herniate or bulge, which could be pressing on your sciatic nerve. Patient. I was afraid of that. What kind of tests or exams do I need to determine if it's a herniated disc? Doctor. We'll start with a physical examination to assess your range of motion, strength, and reflexes. I'll also check for any signs of nerve compression, such as numbness or tingling in your leg. If we suspect a herniated disc or another structural issue, I may recommend imaging tests like an MRI, which provides a detailed view of the soft tissues in your back, including the discs and nerves. Patient. That makes sense. What kind of treatment options are available if it turns out to be a herniated disc? Doctor. Treatment for a herniated disc often starts with conservative measures. These can include physical therapy. A physical therapist can guide you through exercises to strengthen the muscles around your spine, improve flexibility, and reduce pressure on the affected nerve. This can help alleviate pain and prevent further injury. Medications over the counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen can help reduce pain and inflammation. In some cases, muscle relaxants or prescription pain medications may be necessary. Hot and cold therapy. Applying ice to the affected area can help reduce inflammation in the first 48 hours, followed by heat therapy to relax the muscles and improve blood flow. Lifestyle modifications. It's important to avoid activities that exacerbate the pain, such as heavy lifting or prolonged sitting. Maintaining good posture, using ergonomic furniture, and practicing proper body mechanics can also help. Epidural steroid. Injections. If your pain is severe and not improving with other treatments, an epidural steroid injection can reduce inflammation and provide relief. This involves injecting a corticosteroid directly into the area around the nerve. Surgery. Surgery is usually considered a last resort when conservative treatments have failed to relieve symptoms and there's significant nerve compression causing pain, weakness, or loss of function. Procedures like a microdiscectomy, where the herniated portion of the disc is removed, can be very effective. Patient. I'd like to avoid surgery if possible. How long do you think it might take to feel better with physical therapy and other conservative treatments? Doctor. Most people with a herniated disc start to feel better within a few weeks to a few months with conservative treatments. It's important to be patient and consistent with your physical therapy exercises and to make the necessary lifestyle adjustments. Avoiding activities that strain your back and focusing on strengthening your core muscles can make a big difference. Patient. I'll do whatever it takes. Is there anything I can do to prevent this from happening again? Doctor. Preventing future back problems involves a combination of strengthening exercises, proper body mechanics, and lifestyle changes. Here are some tips. Strengthen your core. A strong core helps support your spine and reduces the risk of injury. Exercises like planks, bridges, and pelvic tilts can be very beneficial. Maintain a healthy weight. Excess weight, especially around the abdomen, puts extra strain on your lower back. Maintaining a healthy weight through diet and exercise can help reduce this strain. Practice good posture. Whether you're sitting, standing, or lifting, maintaining proper posture is key to protecting your back. Keep your back straight, shoulders back, and avoid slouching. Use proper lifting techniques. When lifting heavy objects, bend at the knees, not at the waist. Keep the object close to your body and use your leg muscles to lift rather than your back. Stay active. Regular physical activity helps keep your back muscles flexible and strong. Low-impact activities like walking, swimming, or cycling are great for maintaining overall back health. Ergonomics. Make sure your work environment is ergonomically friendly. Use a chair that supports your lower back. Keep your computer monitor at eye level, and take breaks to stretch if you're sitting for long periods. Patient. Those are great tips. I'll definitely work on incorporating them into my daily routine. Should I follow up with you after starting treatment? Doctor. Yes, I'd like to see you in about four to six weeks to assess your progress and make any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan. If you're not seeing improvement or if your symptoms worsen, we may need to consider additional treatments or refer you to a specialist. In the meantime, if you have any concerns or if your pain becomes unmanageable, don't hesitate to contact me. Patient. I appreciate that. Doctor. I feel more confident about managing this now. I'll start with the physical therapy and the other recommendations you've made. Doctor. I'm glad to hear that. Remember, it's important to be consistent with your exercises and mindful of your body mechanics. With time and effort, most people with back problems see significant improvement. We'll work together to get you back to feeling your best. Patient. Thank you. Doctor. I'll see you in a few weeks. Doctor. You're welcome. Take care, and I'll see you soon.";"2024-09-25 09:17:55";"120";"DV001"

"Good morning Alex, it's nice to see you again. How have you been since our last visit? Hi Dr. Martinez, I have been okay. I guess some days are really tough. I appreciate your honesty. It's normal to have ups and downs. Can you tell me about one of your tougher days? What made it difficult? Well, there was a day last week I could not stop hearing the voices. They were really loud and I felt like I was losing control. I'm sorry to hear that Alex. I must have been overwhelming. When the voices are loud, how do they affect you? They say things like I'm worthless and nobody cares about me. It's hard to ignore them. That sounds really painful. How do you usually cope when they become overwhelming? I try to distract myself, listen to music or watch TV but sometimes it doesn't work. It's good that you are finding ways to distract yourself. Have you noticed any specific trigger that makes the voices worse for you? Yeah, stress definitely makes it worse. Like when I go to family gatherings or when work gets busy. Family gatherings can be particularly challenging. How do you feel about attending those events? I love my family but I also feel anxious around them. They don't really understand what I'm going through and I don't want to scare them. It's understandable to feel that way. It can be difficult to share your experience especially when others may not fully grasp the complexity of schizophrenia. Can you share how your family typically reacts when you try to discuss your condition? They mean well but they often say things like just think positive or you will get over it. It feels dismissive. That must be frustrating for you. You deserve to be heard and understood. If you are comfortable, would you mind sharing a little more about your experience with the voices? What do they say and how often do you hear them? They can be pretty persistent especially when I'm alone. It varies but I hear them almost daily. Sometimes they talk about things from my past, bringing up mistakes I made. That sounds distressing. Revisiting past mistakes can be particularly hard. Are there specific memories that come up frequently? Yeah, like when I drop out of college I always feel I fail everyone including myself. Dropping out can weigh heavy on your mind. It's common to have regrets but I want you to know that your family is there for you. I want you to know that your worth is not defined by your academic achievements. Have you discussed your feelings about your college with anyone? Not really. I don't want to burden anyone with my issues. You are not a burden Alex. It's okay to share your feelings. Sometimes talking about these experiences can help lighten the load. Speaking of support, do you have friends or someone you trust who you can talk to? I have a couple of friends but I have been isolating myself lately. I feel embarrassed about the voices and I don't want to explain it to them. Isolation can be tough. It's natural to feel embarrassed but true friends will want to support you through difficult times. Would you be open to the idea of discussing your experiences with them? Maybe it's just hard to find the right words. It's understandable. Sometimes it helps to prepare what you want to say beforehand. You might find that your friends can provide a lot of support and understanding changing topics a bit. How have you been managing your medication? I have been taking it but I forgot sometimes, especially on days when I am feeling really down. Consistency is important for your treatment. Have you thought about using reminders like setting alarms on your phone and keeping a medication log? I could try that. I just get so caught up in everything that I forget. That's a great plan. It might help you feel more in control. Can I ask you more about your current living situation? How is it going for you? It's okay. I guess I live alone and sometimes feel lonely other times. I like the quiet. Living alone can have its pros and cons. When you are feeling isolated, do you have any strategies to reach out to others? Not really. I mostly just stay in my apartment. It feels safer that way. Safety is important but too much isolation can contribute to feeling worse perhaps. You can explore some small steps for you to connect with others even if it's just a text or a phone call. That might be good. I just need to work up the courage. It's okay to take small steps at your own pace. Every little effort counts. Also, have you been able to engage in any hobbies or activities that you enjoy? I used to love drawing but I have not done it much lately. When I am feeling low, it's hard to pick up a pencil. Art can be a wonderful outlet for expressing your feelings. Would you consider setting aside a little time each week to draw even if just for a few minutes? That might help. I used to feel so relaxed when I draw. That's great to hear. Finding activities can bring you joy and can really help with managing symptoms. Before we wrap up, I want to revisit something we discussed earlier. Have you felt about scheduling next appointment? It's important to keep up our work together. I would like that it helps to talk things through with you. I am glad you feel that way, Alex. Remember, you are not alone with this. We are in this together and I am here to support you every step of the way. Thank you, Dr. Martinez. That means a lot to me. Thank you.";"2024-09-25 07:12:32";"119";"AL0012"

"Good morning, Mrs. Smith. I'm Dr. Johnson, and I'll be seeing you today. How are you feeling? Good morning, Dr. Johnson. I'm feeling okay, but I've been having some issues lately. I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss what's been bothering you. Please have a seat and make yourself comfortable. Can I offer you some water or anything else before we begin? No, thank you. I'm all right. All right then, let's dive into it. I want to ensure we cover all your concerns today. So, what brings you in today? I've been experiencing some chest pain over the past week, and it's starting to worry me. I see. Chest pain can be concerning. Let's go through this step by step. When did you first notice the chest pain? It started about a week ago. At first, it was just a dull ache, but it's gotten more intense over the past few days. And can you describe the pain? Is it sharp, dull, burning, or something else? It's mostly a dull, heavy feeling, but sometimes it feels like a sharp, stabbing pain. Does the pain radiate to any other part of your body, like your arm, neck, or jaw? Yes, sometimes it moves to my left arm and up to my jaw. That sounds quite uncomfortable. How long does the pain usually last when it occurs? It varies. Sometimes it lasts a few minutes, but other times it can last up to half an hour. Have you noticed any patterns or specific times of day when the pain is more likely to occur? It seems to happen more in the late afternoon or early evening, especially after a long day at work. Have you noticed anything that seems to trigger the pain or make it worse? It seems to get worse when I'm physically active, like when I'm walking or climbing stairs. It also gets worse when I'm stressed. Does anything help relieve the pain? Resting usually helps, and sometimes taking deep breaths makes it feel a bit better. Have you experienced any other symptoms along with the chest pain, such as shortness of breath, sweating, nausea, or dizziness? Yes, I've been feeling short of breath, especially when the pain is bad. I've also felt a bit nauseous at times. Have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet? No, I haven't had any swelling. Have you had any episodes of fainting or nearly fainting? No, I haven't fainted, but I do feel lightheaded sometimes. Have you been keeping track of your blood pressure and blood sugar levels? Yes, I monitor them regularly. My blood pressure has been a bit higher than usual, and my blood sugar has been fluctuating more than normal. It's important that we get those under control. Hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag 4. Past medical history. Have you ever experienced anything like this before? No, this is the first time I've had chest pain like this. Do you have any other medical conditions or chronic illnesses? I have high blood pressure and diabetes, and I take medication for both. Are you currently taking any medications? Yes, I'm taking lisinopril for my blood pressure and metformin for my diabetes. Do you have any allergies to medications? No, I don't have any known allergies. Have you had any recent changes to your medications or dosages? No, my medications have been the same for the past year. Have you had any surgeries or hospitalizations in the past? I had my appendix removed when I was a teenager, but no other surgeries since then. Hashtag hashtag hashtag hashtag 5. Family history. Is there any history of heart disease in your family? Yes, my father had a heart attack when he was 60, and my mother has angina. Anyone else in your family with similar conditions? My older brother also has high blood pressure and cholesterol issues. Any history of diabetes or other chronic conditions in your family? My mother also has diabetes, and my younger sister was recently diagnosed with pre-diabetes. It sounds like there are some significant health issues in your family. It's good that you're proactive about your health. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products? I used to smoke, but I quit about 5 years ago. How about alcohol? Do you drink? I drink occasionally, maybe a glass of wine once or twice a week. What about your diet and exercise habits? I try to eat a balanced diet, but I don't exercise as much as I should. I have a desk job, so I spend a lot of time sitting. Understood. Do you experience a lot of stress in your life? Yes, my job is quite stressful, and I've been dealing with some family issues as well. How do you typically manage your stress? I try to relax by reading or watching TV, but sometimes it's hard to find time for myself. Finding healthy ways to manage stress is crucial for your overall well-being. We can discuss some strategies that might help. Let's do a quick review of your overall health. Have you had any issues with your breathing or lungs, other than the shortness of breath you mentioned? No, my breathing is generally fine, except when the chest pain gets bad. Any problems with your digestion, like heartburn or acid reflux? I do get heartburn occasionally, especially after eating spicy foods. How about your musculoskeletal system? Any joint pain, muscle aches, or back problems? I have some mild arthritis in my knees, but nothing too serious. Any changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels? I've lost a bit of weight recently, and I've been feeling more tired than usual. Have you had any headaches, vision changes, or hearing problems? I get headaches sometimes, but they usually go away with over-the-counter painkillers. No changes in vision or hearing. Any issues with your urinary system, like pain during urination or changes in frequency? No, everything seems normal in that regard. How about your skin? Any rashes, lesions, or other changes? No, my skin seems fine. Alright, let's do a physical examination now. Please lie down on the examination table. Okay. I'll start by checking your vital signs. Your blood pressure is 145 slash 90, and your heart rate is 85 beats per minute. Now, I'll listen to your heart and lungs. Please take a deep breath in and out. Your heart sounds normal, but I do hear some wheezing in your lungs. I'm going to check your abdomen now. Any tenderness when I press here? No, that doesn't hurt. Good. Now, I'll check the pulses in your arms and legs. Everything feels normal. Let me take a look at your legs for any swelling. I don't see any significant swelling. That's a relief. I'm also going to check for any signs of fluid retention. Your weight seems stable, and there are no signs of edema. I'm going to examine your neck for any jugular vein distension, which can be a sign of heart problems. Everything looks normal. That's good to hear. I'm also going to check your reflexes and muscle strength. Please relax your arm. Checks reflexes excellent. Can you push against my hand here? Great. Now the other side. Perfect. Based on your symptoms and physical exam, I recommend we do some tests to get a clearer picture of what's going on. I'll order an electrocardiogram, EKG, to check your heart's electrical activity, a chest x-ray to look at your lungs, and some blood tests to check for markers of heart disease. That sounds like a good idea. We'll get those tests done today, and I'll review the results as soon as they come in. In the meantime, let's talk about some possible causes of your chest pain. What could it be? Chest pain can be caused by a variety of factors. It could be related to your heart, like angina, or a heart attack, but it could also be due to other issues such as acid reflux, a lung condition, or even musculoskeletal problems. The tests will help us narrow it down. I see. How long will it take to get the results? The EKG results will be available immediately. The chest x-ray and blood tests usually take a few hours to a day. I'll contact you as soon as we have all the information. The tests we did today will help us determine if your chest pain is due to a heart condition, like angina, or a heart attack, or if it's related to something else, such as acid reflux or a lung issue. Based on your symptoms and risk factors, there's a possibility it could be angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. That's what I was afraid of. It's good that you came in to get this checked out. Angina can be managed with lifestyle changes, and sometimes procedures to improve blood flow to the heart. Once we have the test results, we'll know more and can create a treatment plan that's right for you. What kind of procedures might be necessary? If we determine that there is significant blockage in your heart's arteries, procedures such as angioplasty or stent placement might be needed to open up the arteries and improve blood flow. In some cases, bypass surgery might be necessary, but that's usually for more severe cases. While we wait for the test results, I want to start you on a medication called nitroglycerin. It helps to relieve chest pain by relaxing the blood vessels and increasing blood flow to the heart. I'll also prescribe a beta blocker to reduce the workload on your heart and lower your blood pressure. Will I need to take these medications long-term? It depends on the results of your tests and how well your symptoms respond to treatment. We might adjust your medications as we go along. It's also important to make some lifestyle changes to reduce your risk factors. What kind of changes? We'll need to work on improving your diet, increasing your physical activity, and managing your stress levels. Quitting smoking was a great step. Reducing alcohol intake and maintaining a healthy weight are also important. Can you provide some guidance on how to make these changes? Absolutely. Let's break it down. Focus on eating a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Try to limit your intake of saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars. I'll refer you to a dietician who can help you create a personalized meal plan. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, such as brisk walking, on most days of the week. If you are not used to exercising, you can start with shorter sessions and gradually increase the duration and intensity. Techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, and progressive muscle relaxation can be very effective. Counseling or therapy can also be beneficial if you find it difficult to manage stress on your own. Opening a healthy diet with regular exercise will help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight. We can set specific, achievable goals for you to work towards. Let's go over some specific steps you can take. For your diet, focus on eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. Try to limit your intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and sodium. I'll refer you to a dietician who can help you create a personalized meal plan. That sounds helpful. I've been wanting to eat healthier but wasn't sure where to start. For exercise, aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity, like brisk walking, on most days of the week. You can start gradually and increase your activity level over time. I'll also give you some resources for stress management techniques, such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, and counseling if needed. I think that would really help. I've been feeling overwhelmed lately. You're not alone in that. Many people find it challenging to manage stress. It's important to find healthy ways to cope. We'll also monitor your diabetes and blood pressure closely to ensure they remain well-controlled. What should I do if I experience severe chest pain again? If you experience severe chest pain that doesn't go away with rest or nitroglycerin, or if you have other symptoms like shortness of breath, sweating, or fainting, you should seek emergency medical attention immediately. It's better to be safe and get it checked out right away. I'll see you again in two weeks to review your test results and see how you're responding to the medications. If you experience any severe chest pain, shortness of breath, or other concerning symptoms before then, please go to the emergency room immediately. Thank you, Dr. Johnson. I'll follow your advice and make the necessary changes. You're welcome, Mrs. Smith. It's great that you're proactive about your health. We'll work together to get you feeling better. Take care, and I'll see you in two weeks. Thank you. See you then.";"2024-09-24 13:48:05";"116";"SEP-24"

I just feel hopeless. Sometimes I think about ending it all. I do not want to be a burden to anyone. It is important that you share those feelings with me. When you mention thoughts of ending it, how often does that come to your mind? Can you let me know? It happens quite often. I have tried to push those thoughts away also, but they keep coming back to me. Oh, I understand. Those thoughts can be overwhelming. Have you had any plans or specific intentions related to those feelings? I thought it about, but I don't know if I would actually do it. I don't know like a way to escape the pain. Thank you for being honest with me. It's crucial we talk about this. What did you really feel about? Actually, when I was in my dark, I just feel the worst. Oh, that's bad to hear.

"Diksha, a 27 year old girl, Diksha explained that she had been experiencing persistent headaches and occasional dizziness for the past couple of weeks, which was starting to interfere with her daily activities. So Dr. Smith asked for more details about the headaches and the patient described them as throbbing pains around the temples and behind the eyes, often worse in the morning and sometimes lasting the entire day. The patient also mentioned accompanying symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to bright light. Dr. Smith inquired about any recent lifestyle changes and the patient admitted to increase work related stress and poor sleep, often getting only five hours of sleep a night. The doctor asked if the patient had a history of migraines or sinus issues and the patient confirmed occasional migraines in the past, usually triggered by certain foods, but noted that these current headaches felt different. Dr. Smith asked the patient to elaborate on his daily routine to better understand any potential contributing factors. The patient explained that he works in a high-pressure job, often staring at computer screens for long hours without taking sufficient breaks. He also mentioned a poor diet, relying on fast food and caffeine to get through the day and noted that exercise had fallen by the wayside due to his busy schedule. Dr. Smith noted thoughtfully taking notes and considering how these factors might be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient also mentioned trying a mirror front which provided limited relief and other measures like drinking more water and taking breaks during work, but nothing seemed to make a significant difference. Dr. Smith then performed a thorough physical examination. He checked the patient's blood pressure which was slightly elevated and measured his heart rate. He examined the patient's eye for any signs of strain or other issues and tested his reflexes and coordination to rule out any neurological problems. The doctor also palpated the patient's neck and shoulders, noting significant tension in these areas which could be contributing to the headaches. After the examination, Dr. Smith explained that the symptom could be due to several factors including stress, lack of sleep and possibly migraines. He suggested some initial steps such as improving hydration, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and trying relaxing techniques like deep breathing exercise, meditation or yoga. He also recommended that the patient keep a headache diary to track the frequency, duration and intensity of the headaches along with any potential triggers. Dr. Smith advised the patient to avoid known migraine triggers like certain foods and to try to manage stress through regular physical activity or mindfulness practices.

"Good morning, how are you feeling today? Good morning, doctor. Honestly, I'm not feeling too great. I have been having a high fever and I'm really weak. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me when the symptoms started and how they have been progressing? It started about four days ago with a mild fever, but it's gotten worse. I have had high fever, severe headaches, joint pain and my body feels achy. I'm also feeling nauseous and I have been vomiting quite a bit. It sounds like you are going through a rough time. Have you had any rashes or bleeding issues like bleeding gums or nosebleeds? I have not had any bleeding, but I had noticed a rash developing yesterday. It's not too severe, just a bit of redness and small spots on my arms and legs. That's useful information based on your symptoms and the rash. Dengue fever is something we need to consider. Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause severe flu-like symptoms. Have you had any recent mosquito bites or travelled to areas known for dengue outbreaks? Yes, I did travel to a region where dengue is common about two weeks ago. I have been bitten by mosquitoes there and I did not really think much of it at that time. That's an important detail. Dengue fever usually has an incubation period of about 4-10 days. So, it makes sense that your symptoms have developed now. We need to do some tests to confirm it. If it's dengue and to assess the severity of your condition, what kind of tests will you be doing? We will start with a blood test to check for the presence of dengue virus or antibodies. We will also access your blood cell counts, especially your platelet levels as dengue can affect these. Additionally, we might need to do some tests to monitor your liver. and kidney function to see if there are any complications. That sounds thorough. I am a bit worried about my condition. What should I expect if it is dengue? It's understandable to be concerned that dengue can range from mild to severe. Most cases are mild and involve symptoms like high fever, pain and rash which usually involve on their own with proper care. However, in severe cases, it can lead to dengue, hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome which require more intense treatment and monitoring. What are the signs of severe dengue that I should watch out for? Severe dengue can persist with more serious symptoms such as persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, blood bleeding, gums, difficulty breathing and a significant drop in blood pressure. If you notice any of these symptoms, you need to seek medical help immediately. I'll keep an eye on that. How do you manage dengue fever? For most people, the management includes plenty of fresh fluids to stay hydrated and medications to manage symptoms like fever and pain. We usually advise avoiding medications like aspirin or non-stereotype anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs because they can increase the risk of bleeding. Is there anything specific I should eat or avoid? It's important to stay hydrated. So, drink plenty of fluids like water, oral rehydration solution or clear soups. Eating light and easily digestible food can also help if you are having nausea. Avoid oily and spicy food might be a good idea if your stomach is upset. What about my activity levels? Should I rest completely? Yes, rest is crucial. Avoid strenuous activities and ensure you get adequate sleep. Your body needs energy to fight off the infection to try to take it easy. How long will it take for me to start feeling better? Most people start feeling better within a week to 10 days. However, recovery can vary from person to person. It's important to follow up on your condition and adhere to any recommendations or treatment provided. I'll make sure to follow up your advice. How often should I come in for checkups? Initially, we need to monitor your condition closely. So, I would recommend coming in for follow-up visits every couple of days to track your progress. Once your symptoms start improving and your test results are more stable, we can adjust the frequency of visits. I appreciate your help and guidance, doctor. I'm a bit anxious now. But to expect your welcome, it's completely normal to feel anxious. But remember that we are here to support you through this. If you have any questions or concerns, in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you. I'll definitely keep in touch and follow your recommendations. Good. I'm glad to hear that. Make sure to take care of yourself. I'll see you at our next appointment. We'll do thanks again for everything. You're welcome. Take care and see you soon. Goodbye, doctor.

"Dr. Good Morning, Karen. I understand you're here because of a leg injury. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened? Karen. Good morning, Dr. Yes. I hurt my leg last week. I was playing soccer with friends and I twisted my leg awkwardly while trying to change direction. Quickly. It felt like something pulled or strained. Since then, it's been swollen and painful. Dr. I see. Can you describe the pain for me? Is it sharp, dull, throbbing, or aching? Karen. It's mostly a dull ache, but it gets sharper when I try to move or put weight on it. The pain is concentrated around my ankle and the lower part of my leg. Dr. How would you rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable? Karen. On most days, it's around a 5 or 6. It spikes up to 8 or 9 if I try to walk or stand for too long. Dr. Have you noticed any swelling, bruising, or changes in color in your leg? Karen. Yes, there's definitely swelling, and it's a bit bruised around the ankle. The bruising seems to be getting worse, and it's hard to move my foot properly. Dr. Have you tried any treatments or home remedies so far? Karen. I've been icing it and keeping it elevated. I've also taken some over-the-counter painkillers, but they only help a little. Dr. Have you had any other symptoms like fever or numbness in the leg? Karen. No fever, but sometimes it feels like my leg is a bit numb, especially after I've been sitting for a while. Objective. Dr. Alright, let me examine your leg now. I'm going to check for any visible signs of injury and assess the range of motion. Doctor performs a physical examination, inspecting the leg for swelling, bruising, and tenderness. The doctor also palpates the area and assesses the range of motion in the ankle and lower leg. Doctor. From what I can see, there is significant swelling around the ankle, and there is some bruising. The range of motion is limited, especially in terms of dorsiflexion. There's noticeable tenderness over the lateral aspect of the ankle. Assessment. Doctor. Based on your description and my examination, it looks like you might have a sprain, possibly a grade 2 sprain, given the level of swelling and pain. A grade 2 sprain involves partial tearing of the ligaments, and it would explain the tenderness, swelling, and bruising you're experiencing. Karen. That sounds about right. I was worried it might be something more serious. Doctor. It's good you came in for a proper assessment. We should also consider getting an x-ray to rule out any fractures or significant damage to the bones, as sometimes fractures can present with similar symptoms. Karen. That makes sense. I'd prefer to make sure it's nothing more severe. Plan. Doctor. Here's what we'll do. Order x-rays to rule out fractures and confirm the extent of ligament injury. Rest and elevation. Continue to keep the leg elevated and avoid putting weight on it as much as possible. Ice therapy. Apply ice packs to reduce swelling and numb the area. Do this for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for the first 48 hours. Pain management. Continue with over-the-counter pain medication, but if the pain becomes unmanageable, let me know, and we might consider a stronger prescription. Compression. Use an elastic bandage to compress the injured area, which can help control swelling. Follow-up. I'd like to see you back here in a week to check on your progress and review the x-ray results. Karen. Thank you. Doctor. I'll get the x-ray done today and follow your instructions. Doctor. Great. If. You notice any worsening symptoms, such as increased pain, significant changes in color, or if. You're unable to move your toes, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, we'll review. Everything next week and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Karen. I'll keep an eye on it. Thanks for your help. Doctor. You're welcome. Karen. I hope you start feeling better soon. Take. Care and follow the plan. See you next week.";"2024-09-23 12:35:27";"114";"GP-0121"

Dr. I see. Can you describe the pain for me? Is it sharp, dull, throbbing, or aching? Karen. It's mostly a dull ache, but it gets sharper when I try to move or put weight on it. The pain is concentrated around my ankle and the lower part of my leg. Dr. How would you rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable? Karen. On most days, it's around a 5 or 6. It spikes up to 8 or 9 if I try to walk or stand for too long. Dr. Have you noticed any swelling, bruising, or changes in color in your leg? Karen. Yes, there's definitely swelling, and it's a bit bruised around the ankle. The bruising seems to be getting worse, and it's hard to move my foot properly. Dr. Have you tried any treatments or home remedies so far? Karen. I've been icing it and keeping it elevated. I've also taken some over-the-counter painkillers, but they only help a little. Dr. Have you had any other symptoms like fever or numbness in the leg? Karen. No fever, but sometimes it feels like my leg is a bit numb, especially after I've been sitting for a while. Objective. Dr. Alright, let me examine your leg now. I'm going to check for any visible signs of injury and assess the range of motion. Doctor performs a physical examination, inspecting the leg for swelling, bruising, and tenderness. The doctor also palpates the area and assesses the range of motion in the ankle and lower leg. Doctor. From what I can see, there is significant swelling around the ankle, and there is some bruising. The range of motion is limited, especially in terms of dorsiflexion. There's noticeable tenderness over the lateral aspect of the ankle. Assessment. Doctor. Based on your description and my examination, it looks like you might have a sprain, possibly a grade 2 sprain, given the level of swelling and pain. A grade 2 sprain involves partial tearing of the ligaments, and it would explain the tenderness, swelling, and bruising you're experiencing. Karen. That sounds about right. I was worried it might be something more serious. Doctor. It's good you came in for a proper assessment. We should also consider getting an x-ray to rule out any fractures or significant damage to the bones, as sometimes fractures can present with similar symptoms. Karen. That makes sense. I'd prefer to make sure it's nothing more severe. Plan. Doctor. Here's what we'll do. Order x-rays to rule out fractures and confirm the extent of ligament injury. Rest and elevation. Continue to keep the leg elevated and avoid putting weight on it as much as possible. Ice therapy. Apply ice packs to reduce swelling and numb the area. Do this for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for the first 48 hours. Pain management. Continue with over-the-counter pain medication, but if the pain becomes unmanageable, let me know, and we might consider a stronger prescription. Compression. Use an elastic bandage to compress the injured area, which can help control swelling. Follow-up. I'd like to see you back here in a week to check on your progress and review the x-ray results. Karen. Thank you. Doctor. I'll get the x-ray done today and follow your instructions. Doctor. Great. If. You notice any worsening symptoms, such as increased pain, significant changes in color, or if. You're unable to move your toes, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, we'll review. Everything next week and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Karen. I'll keep an eye on it. Thanks for your help. Doctor. You're welcome. Karen. I hope you start feeling better soon. Take. Care and follow the plan. See you next week.";"2024-09-23 11:27:06";"114";"GP-0121"
"Edgmund, European Journal of Medical and Health Sciences Vol. 1, No. 4, October 2019 Good communication between doctor-patient improves health outcome J. Furtis and S. Hibba Abstract communication between doctor and patient has a very important impact on health outcomes. It is basic component of any relationship especially when it is between physician and patient. It should be very strong and comprehensive. A good communication improves patient's consistence and satisfaction. It is a moral duty of a doctor that he should clear each and every query of the patient and to facilitate a patient regarding treatment and its consequences. Keywords Communication, Comprehensive, Consequences, Satisfaction I. Introduction Communication The human connection is the key to personal and career success. Paul J. Meyer Communication is an essential and integral skill for establishing physician-patient relationships and for effective functioning among healthcare professionals. Good communication skill in a doctor improves patient's compliance and overall satisfaction. Patient listening, empathy, and paying attention to the verbal and nonverbal components of the communication are the important ones. Studies have shown that good communication skill in a doctor improve patient's compliance and overall satisfaction. This skill can be learned effectively during the training program for undergraduate medical students, thereby helping students to practice efficiently in patient care settings. II. Patient-Centered Communication The patient-centered clinical method commonly used for interacting with patients. Usually the patient doesn't know the medical terminologies often speak by physicians and nurses or abbreviations, symbols written on a patient's file. To clarify each and every detail regarding disease, treatment, or any intervention is very important. Doctor-patient communication should be perfect to get best ultimate results of patient's health too. The practice of good communication skills in the medical profession is integral for the development of meaningful and trustworthy relationship between the doctors and patients. The UK's General Medical Council, GMC, emphasizes effective communication as fundamental to good medical practice. When teaching and assessing communication in the context of medical education the primary emphasis is on skills, suggesting that communication can be taught, learned, and improved.To pass on any information, wordings are significant, particularly if it is between specialist and patient. It's a human instinct that every patient is constantly worried about his own health, similar to what's happening in his body and when he would recoup. In this way, a good medical practitioner ought to be exceptionally cautious while advising anything to the patient. Three Benefits of Good Communication The diagnostic capability of the doctor is greatly enhanced useful in managing difficult clinical encounters and thus decreases the frustration of work stress and increased job satisfaction patient's level of satisfaction is improved by better recognition and understanding of their ailment and disease outcome. Good communication skills enable doctors to elicit information about a patient's stress and distress that is comprehensive, relevant and accurate. It has been shown that doctors, who have received training in communication skills, are more likely to detect and diagnose emotional and psychological distress and respond to patient's need appropriately than those who had not sought such training. Communication is a complex phenomenon, good communication skills are more likely to make patients satisfied. Definitions vary in their emphasis on the verbal, nonverbal, content, process, informational, relational and cultural aspects of communication. Communication involves not only verbal and nonverbal interaction but also observing each other. Therefore, special skill sets are required to implement good communication. The skills include active listening, questioning, conveying information, inspiring others to speak. As clinicians we are often required to communicate with patients who have very different backgrounds. Physicians have diverse ethnicity, religious beliefs and social levels. Communication with people of different backgrounds is called cross-culture communication. Cross-culture communication is a part of cultural competence, which has been taught in many medical schools. For maintain trust with patients firstly, trust is an immensely important part of any relationship. Patients occasionally reveal their secrets and worries to doctors that they never have passed on, even to their family members. But if patient doesn't reveal these secrets or personal history of addictions to doctor thinking that he might disclose it before someone, it could lead to severe adverse reactions with clinician's medications. For example, alcoholics are at higher rates of pharmacological interactions. However, a doctor must stay legit with his patients and tell every positive and negative aspect of treatments he is going to give his patient, and maintain confidentiality of his patient. 4. October 2000 and 19 v. Clear the misconceptions of patients Patients' own perceptions regarding susceptibility to the disease have been found to be an important determinant of health-seeking behavior. Without good at communication, none can convey the exact meaning of conversation. Now it has become an important part of training of medical graduates over the entire world. However, there are number of misunderstandings could be created if there is no proper counseling of the patient would be done. Most misunderstanding in the world could be avoided if people would simply take the time to ask, what else could this mean? Shannon L. Alder, It's a moral obligation of doctor to explain each and every aspect of disease like its nature, course, causes, prognosis, and its treatment options and treatment cost. Sometimes patient has to select an options for his treatment, this needs intense focus on consequences of each option. While on the basis of experiences, a recommendation by doctor has separate significance. Usually patients are worried about their futures and want to know that how much their condition affects their lives. Due to misconceptions, patient could take wrong decisions and could go into more distress state, leading to prolonged illness. For instance, patients with type 2 diabetes have often misconception in regards to insulin treatment and this can have impact in their decision on whether or not to initiate the treatment 11. A misbelief of patient is often due to having incomplete background knowledge of disease and its treatment plans. An observational survey was done at Los Angeles County Public Hospital Emergency Department 2015, to collect data from patients, regarding basic knowledge of appendicitis, past surgical and antibiotic history, and medical illness outcome priorities. Out of 129 subjects interviewed, 56, 43%, accurately explained appendicitis, and 69, 53%, picked out the treatment for appendicitis as surgery. When presented with a hypothetical acute appendicitis scenario, more than 50% subjects preferred antibiotics over surgery 12. So, prior to provide any information in advance, try to observe what a patient already knows about his or her condition. Then, it is very essential to let patient know that many diseases could have same symptoms but their causes and treatment plans are totally different. Otherwise patient may refuse medical advice and developed high risks. 6. Patient safety Most of the time doctors are tired on their long hour duties or might be due to the tremendous number of patients in clinics, they want to avoid patients emotional discussions and problems. This often tends to increase patients' distress, as a result of which the patient feels wavering to unveil his problems which could defer the recovery of patient. The alarming numbers of patients reportedly harmed and even killed by medical errors have prompted the development of numerous transdisciplinary, evidence-based strategies to improve patient safety. Studies have also shown that the rate of medication errors resulting in serious medical outcomes is because of lack of effective communication. A healthy communication between patient and doctor has very important impact on patient's follow-up, because first time, you have dealt with patient properly, counseled the patient in detail, it may reduce the need for admissions and readmissions in future 14-15. 7. Barriers of communication Even when the patient may know the little English, there is always a doubt whether he understands the message doctor or not. The main unfavorable impact of language barrier is that patient could not comprehend that at which time he should take meds and at what dose. Although many research papers have been described the problems doctors are facing regarding language barrier in healthcare system and its impact on patient's expectations 16-17. A cross-sectional study was done in five urban teaching hospitals emergency departments in the Northeastern United States, to assess patient's satisfaction and willingness to return to an emergency department among non-English speakers. Overall, only 52% of non-English speaking patients were satisfied as compared with 71% of English speaking patients, p.01. On the other hand, 14% non-English speaking patients said they would not return to the same emergency department if they had another problem requiring emergency care as compared with 9.5% of English speaking patients, p.05, 18-19. Consequently, it has become very important that doctor who is treating the patient in clinical setup, knows patient's primary language properly, to convey the details regarding his health. Another solution that has given by many authors to overcome this language barrier problem is to provide interpreter services at emergency department and in outpatient department, as it indicated good results of understanding between doctor and patient communication 20-21. Physicians have to deal with number of patients, some of them have high health literacy, that are much aware of their illnesses, and some are illiterate usually with less education, low incomes and in minority. A clinician must determine the patient's degree of understanding so that he could clarify his queries in more detail. Many therapies like intravaginal rings, dermal implants, patches, inhalers and subcutaneous depot, require special instructions to ensure proper administration 22-23. It is very important to explain each prescription to patient in detail whether with high health literacy or with low, because identifying patients with limited health literacy can be difficult and is often undetected by doctor and can lead to negative effects on patient's health 24. Common questions of patients and their family members are often about the diagnosis, its prognosis, effective medications, cons and pros of treatment, cost of treatment. If admission needed, how long would be the stay in the hospital? A healthcare professional should satisfy the patient concerning his every query 2526. Emergency department is a place where every patient arrives in a misery state, often terrified, anxious and generally comes with blood/. Injection phobias. In this situation, poor behavior and harsh wordings could prompt disappointment in the patient. DOI, http://dx.doi.org/.10.24018/.2019.1.4.84.2. EDGMD, European Journal of Medical and Health Sciences Vol. 1, No. 4, October 2000 and 19 A pilot study was done for a case study in a single clinic in Malaysia. They used audio tape for recording of doctor-patient communication, in a time period of three months , Feb, April 2015, and qualitative data was obtained. The objective of study was to investigate politeness strategies used between doctor and patient in a private clinic, with reference to Brown and Levinson's politeness theory. This result has shown that 45.38% of maximum politeness strategy used by the doctors and patient is the bald-on-record type, followed by 31.09% of negative politeness strategy, 19.33% of positive politeness strategy and 19.33% with the last strategy being the off-record strategy. In this way, patients feel more comfortable with elaborating questions by doctors rather than bald-on-record strategy, as it has indicated the disappointments in patients either male or female, with specialists' discussions and during follow-up visits. 8. Breaking Bad News Any information which antagonistically and genuinely influences a person's perspective on his future is defined Breaking Bad News. 28. In doctor-patient interaction, a clinician's selection of vocabulary, expressions and appropriate wordings mean a lot, to clarify the exact thing. Breaking Bad News is extremely unpleasant and troublesome, particularly when there is no treatment options remained. However, the conveyance of awful news by the health professionals to their patients is a key moment in the doctor-patient relationship. 29. This troublesome task requires persistence and refined relational abilities between the clinician and the patient. Bringing negative news to patient or his relatives needs professionalism, confidence, patience and vitality. A study had been conducted to find out how patients judge the worthiness of doctor's communication of bad news. The results showed that the quality of information and emotional strength explained more than 95% the variance in patients' acceptability judgments, while the level of badness of the news had no effect and patients expect high levels of both sympathy and information quality, regardless of how terrible the news. 30. 9. Empathy for patient Empathy is another essential component of doctor-patient communication. Empathy as a characteristic of patient-physician communication in both general practice and clinical care is considered to be the backbone of the patient-physician relationship. Physicians' empathy for the patient and patient compassion for the doctor together can improve correspondence and promote further understanding of one another's points of view. 31. Patients follow those physicians order more, who have greater empathy for them as compared to physicians having less sympathy. 32. Clinicians, who wish to improve patient's satisfaction and consistence should initially recognize the elements of the empathic communication and afterward attempt to refine their aptitudes to more readily serve patients. 33. Another component of empathy that has an immense impact on patient's satisfaction is the doctor's tone of voice. A doctor must talk in a very polite and calm way. Most of the patients feel relaxed and unstressed when a clinician communicate nicely and calmly. A demanding and baffling patient may outrage the physician. 34. But it is a duty of a doctor to control his anger and remain calm. Ex-conclusion This review summarizes that how intense the impact of physicians' verbal communication is on patient's satisfaction and health. To get best results, various strategies regarding doctor-patient communication are immensely significant. Good and effective communication can improve patient's satisfaction, understanding of disease, improve compliance-slash-adherence to drugs and ultimately improve outcome of care. Some of the barriers of effective communications are poor language, time constrain, poor listening skills and lack of empathy. However, improvement in these strategies helps the patients to recover more efficiently and gives better health outcome.

"Diksha, a 27 year old girl, Diksha explained that she had been experiencing persistent headaches and occasional dizziness for the past couple of weeks, which was starting to interfere with her daily activities. So Dr. Smith asked for more details about the headaches and the patient described them as throbbing pains around the temples and behind the eyes, often worse in the morning and sometimes lasting the entire day. The patient also mentioned accompanying symptoms such as nausea and sensitivity to bright light. Dr. Smith inquired about any recent lifestyle changes and the patient admitted to increase work related stress and poor sleep, often getting only five hours of sleep a night. The doctor asked if the patient had a history of migraines or sinus issues and the patient confirmed occasional migraines in the past, usually triggered by certain foods, but noted that these current headaches felt different. Dr. Smith asked the patient to elaborate on his daily routine to better understand any potential contributing factors. The patient explained that he works in a high-pressure job, often staring at computer screens for long hours without taking sufficient breaks. He also mentioned a poor diet, relying on fast food and caffeine to get through the day and noted that exercise had fallen by the wayside due to his busy schedule. Dr. Smith noted thoughtfully taking notes and considering how these factors might be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient also mentioned trying a mirror front which provided limited relief and other measures like drinking more water and taking breaks during work, but nothing seemed to make a significant difference. Dr. Smith then performed a thorough physical examination. He checked the patient's blood pressure which was slightly elevated and measured his heart rate. He examined the patient's eye for any signs of strain or other issues and tested his reflexes and coordination to rule out any neurological problems. The doctor also palpated the patient's neck and shoulders, noting significant tension in these areas which could be contributing to the headaches. After the examination, Dr. Smith explained that the symptom could be due to several factors including stress, lack of sleep and possibly migraines. He suggested some initial steps such as improving hydration, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and trying relaxing techniques like deep breathing exercise, meditation or yoga. He also recommended that the patient keep a headache diary to track the frequency, duration and intensity of the headaches along with any potential triggers. Dr. Smith advised the patient to avoid known migraine triggers like certain foods and to try to manage stress through regular physical activity or mindfulness practices. Dr. Smith elaborated on the importance of a balanced diet, suggesting the patient incorporate more fruits, vegetables and whole grains and reduce the intake of caffeine and processed foods. Processed foods are too harmful for the body and caffeine will never ever get you sleep as early. So, he recommended the patient to set regular breaks during work to avoid prolonged sleep time and practice the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eyestrain. Dr. Smith suggested over-the-counter options like acetamiphone or naproxen as alternatives to ibuprofen and recommended the patient consider lifestyle changes such as reducing screen time before bed and creating a more restful sleep environment including keeping the bedroom cool and dark, avoiding screens for at least an hour before bedtime and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. Yes, that's good to hear. Yes. Dr. Smith discussed the possibility of using apps or wearable devices to monitor stress levels and encourage mindfulness and physical activity. He also mentioned that if the headaches persisted or worsened, prescription medications or referral to a neurologist for further evaluation might be necessary. The doctor reassured the patient that many people experience similar symptoms due to lifestyle factors and that making these changes could significantly improve high quality of life. Finally, Dr. Smith advised scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to monitor progress and discuss further tests or referrals to a specialist. If the headache persisted, he provided the patient with an educational pamphlet on stress management, sleep hygiene, and dietary changes. The patient thanked Dr. Smith for his thorough assessment and left the office feeling hopeful about managing his symptoms with the new strategies suggested and thanked for the same.";"2024-09-23 11:13:12";"114";"GP-0121"
"Dr. Good Morning, Karen. I understand you're here because of a leg injury. Can you tell me a bit more about what happened? Karen. Good morning, Dr. Yes. I hurt my leg last week. I was playing soccer with friends and I twisted my leg awkwardly while trying to change direction. Quickly. It felt like something pulled or strained. Since then, it's been swollen and painful. Dr. I see. Can you describe the pain for me? Is it sharp, dull, throbbing, or aching? Karen. It's mostly a dull ache, but it gets sharper when I try to move or put weight on it. The pain is concentrated around my ankle and the lower part of my leg. Dr. How would you rate your pain on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable? Karen. On most days, it's around a 5 or 6. It spikes up to 8 or 9 if I try to walk or stand for too long. Dr. Have you noticed any swelling, bruising, or changes in color in your leg? Karen. Yes, there's definitely swelling, and it's a bit bruised around the ankle. The bruising seems to be getting worse, and it's hard to move my foot properly. Dr. Have you tried any treatments or home remedies so far? Karen. I've been icing it and keeping it elevated. I've also taken some over-the-counter painkillers, but they only help a little. Dr. Have you had any other symptoms like fever or numbness in the leg? Karen. No fever, but sometimes it feels like my leg is a bit numb, especially after I've been sitting for a while. Objective. Dr. Alright, let me examine your leg now. I'm going to check for any visible signs of injury and assess the range of motion. Doctor performs a physical examination, inspecting the leg for swelling, bruising, and tenderness. The doctor also palpates the area and assesses the range of motion in the ankle and lower leg. Doctor. From what I can see, there is significant swelling around the ankle, and there is some bruising. The range of motion is limited, especially in terms of dorsiflexion. There's noticeable tenderness over the lateral aspect of the ankle. Assessment. Doctor. Based on your description and my examination, it looks like you might have a sprain, possibly a grade 2 sprain, given the level of swelling and pain. A grade 2 sprain involves partial tearing of the ligaments, and it would explain the tenderness, swelling, and bruising you're experiencing. Karen. That sounds about right. I was worried it might be something more serious. Doctor. It's good you came in for a proper assessment. We should also consider getting an x-ray to rule out any fractures or significant damage to the bones, as sometimes fractures can present with similar symptoms. Karen. That makes sense. I'd prefer to make sure it's nothing more severe. Plan. Doctor. Here's what we'll do. Order x-rays to rule out fractures and confirm the extent of ligament injury. Rest and elevation. Continue to keep the leg elevated and avoid putting weight on it as much as possible. Ice therapy. Apply ice packs to reduce swelling and numb the area. Do this for 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours for the first 48 hours. Pain management. Continue with over-the-counter pain medication, but if the pain becomes unmanageable, let me know, and we might consider a stronger prescription. Compression. Use an elastic bandage to compress the injured area, which can help control swelling. Follow-up. I'd like to see you back here in a week to check on your progress and review the x-ray results. Karen. Thank you. Doctor. I'll get the x-ray done today and follow your instructions. Doctor. Great. If. You notice any worsening symptoms, such as increased pain, significant changes in color, or if. You're unable to move your toes, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, we'll review. Everything next week and adjust the treatment plan as needed. Karen. I'll keep an eye on it. Thanks for your help. Doctor. You're welcome. Karen. I hope you start feeling better soon. Take. Care and follow the plan. See you next week.";"2024-09-23 11:10:36";"114";"GP-0121"

"Namaste, it's good to meet you, how are you? Namaste, Doctor, I am fine, thank you. Ok, so tell me, what is the reason you have come here? Doctor, I have been having stomach pain since last few days, especially when I eat. I do some work outside. I understand, apart from stomach pain, you are also experiencing any other problem, like vomiting, cough or fever. Yes, sometimes I feel a slight nausea and sometimes I feel cough. I don't have fever, but I am definitely feeling weakness in my body. Ok, I understand, what is your age? Doctor, I am 20 years old. Ok, so according to your age, this problem is not normal. Now I have to ask you some questions so that we can understand your problem properly. Have you recently started any new food or medicine? No, I have not started any new food or medicine. Yes, I have started having more tea and breakfast in the last few months. This can also be a reason, sometimes unbalanced food can cause stomach pain and other problems. Have you recently experienced any stress or mental pressure? Yes, I have been stressed due to my studies and job. Stress can also be a big reason for stomach problems. Apart from your daily routine and diet, do you have any type of allergy or any particular food problem? No, I am not allergic to any food, but yes, I do have some problem with spicy food. Ok, thank you for sharing your information. Now, I will give you some advice to do some normal tests. First, we will have to do a stomach test, after that some blood tests and ultrasound can also be done so that we can know the right reason. Doctor, why are these tests necessary? There can be many reasons for stomach pain, like gastritis, ulcer or digestive problems. These tests will help us understand what is the cause of stomach pain and can be treated accordingly. Ok, Doctor, you can tell us about the tests in detail. First, I will check your stomach and see what is the cause of your stomach pain. After this, we will know about your blood condition and see if there is any swelling or infection. We can see the structure of the stomach from ultrasound and can be sure that there is no serious problem. Do I need any special preparation for these tests? Yes, you may have to fast in the morning for some tests, but I will give you detailed information about each test so that you do not have any problem. Ok, Doctor, when should I do these tests? You can take an appointment for these tests today itself. For blood tests and ultrasound, you will have to go to the medical lab or hospital. If you need any information or have any problem, you can contact me. Thank you, Doctor. Do you think there is any treatment for this problem? Yes, it is possible. After the results of the tests, we will give you the right treatment and medicines. Along with this, we will also give you some advice on changing your diet and lifestyle. Thank you, Doctor. I will come back to you after the tests. Thank you. You can do the tests on time. If you have any further questions, you can contact me. Thank you, Doctor. Welcome. Take care and stay healthy. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye.";"2024-09-20 13:36:51";"112";"AP001"
"Good morning, how are you feeling today? Good morning, doctor. Honestly, I'm not feeling too great. I have been having a high fever and I'm really weak. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me when the symptoms started and how they have been progressing? It started about four days ago with a mild fever, but it's gotten worse. I have had high fever, severe headaches, joint pain and my body feels achy. I'm also feeling nauseous and I have been vomiting quite a bit. It sounds like you are going through a rough time. Have you had any rashes or bleeding issues like bleeding gums or nosebleeds? I have not had any bleeding, but I had noticed a rash developing yesterday. It's not too severe, just a bit of redness and small spots on my arms and legs. That's useful information based on your symptoms and the rash. Dengue fever is something we need to consider. Dengue is a viral infection transmitted by mosquitoes and can cause severe flu-like symptoms. Have you had any recent mosquito bites or travelled to areas known for dengue outbreaks? Yes, I did travel to a region where dengue is common about two weeks ago. I have been bitten by mosquitoes there and I did not really think much of it at that time. That's an important detail. Dengue fever usually has an incubation period of about 4-10 days. So, it makes sense that your symptoms have developed now. We need to do some tests to confirm it. If it's dengue and to assess the severity of your condition, what kind of tests will you be doing? We will start with a blood test to check for the presence of dengue virus or antibodies. We will also access your blood cell counts, especially your platelet levels as dengue can affect these. Additionally, we might need to do some tests to monitor your liver. And kidney function to see if there are any complications. That sounds thorough. I am a bit worried about my condition. What should I expect if it is dengue? It's understandable to be concerned that dengue can range from mild to severe. Most cases are mild and involve symptoms like high fever, pain and rash which usually involve on their own with proper care. However, in severe cases, it can lead to dengue, hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome which require more intense treatment and monitoring. What are the signs of severe dengue that I should watch out for? Severe dengue can persist with more serious symptoms such as persistent abdominal pain, vomiting, blood bleeding, gums, difficulty breathing and a significant drop in blood pressure. If you notice any of these symptoms, you need to seek medical help immediately. I'll keep an eye on that. How do you manage dengue fever? For most people, the management includes plenty of fresh fluids to stay hydrated and medications to manage symptoms like fever and pain. We usually advise avoiding medications like aspirin or non-stereotype anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs because they can increase the risk of bleeding. Is there anything specific I should eat or avoid? It's important to stay hydrated. So, drink plenty of fluids like water, oral rehydration solution or clear soups. Eating light and easily digestible food can also help if you are having nausea. Avoid oily and spicy food might be a good idea if your stomach is upset. What about my activity levels? Should I rest completely? Yes, rest is crucial. Avoid strenuous activities and ensure you get adequate sleep. Your body needs energy to fight off the infection to try to take it easy. How long will it take for me to start feeling better? Most people start feeling better within a week to 10 days. However, recovery can vary from person to person. It's important to follow up on your condition and adhere to any recommendations or treatment provided. I'll make sure to follow up your advice. How often should I come in for checkups? Initially, we need to monitor your condition closely. So, I would recommend coming in for follow-up visits every couple of days to track your progress. Once your symptoms start improving and your test results are more stable, we can adjust the frequency of visits. I appreciate your help and guidance, doctor. I'm a bit anxious now. But to expect your welcome, it's completely normal to feel anxious. But remember that we are here to support you through this. If you have any questions or concerns, in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you. I'll definitely keep in touch and follow your recommendations. Good. I'm glad to hear that. Make sure to take care of yourself. I'll see you at our next appointment. We'll do thanks again for everything. You're welcome. Take care and see you soon. Goodbye, doctor. Goodbye.";"2024-09-20 13:35:32";"113";"AP001"
"Good morning, how are you feeling today? Good morning doctor. I have been better but I am quite concerned about my hair loss. It's been happening for the past few months and seems to be getting worse. I understand your concern, hair loss can be quite distressing. Let's talk about it in more detail. How long have you noticed this hair loss and has it been gradual or sudden? It started about 6 months ago but it has definitely accelerated over the past 2 months. It seems to be falling out more rapidly, especially when I wash or brush my hair. I see it's good that you have brought this up. I need to ask you a few more questions to get a better understanding of your condition. Can you tell me your age? I am 32 years old. Thank you. Are there any other symptoms or changes you have noticed such as changes in your scalp, unusual itching or any other health issues? My scalp sometimes feels a bit itchy but there is no redness or unusual spots. I have also been feeling more stress lately and I have had some recent changes in my diet. Stress and diet can indeed impact your hair health. I need to conduct a physical examination of your scalp and review your medical history to determine the cause of your hair loss. Let's start with the examination. Based on the examination and your symptoms, it seems that you might be experiencing a common condition known as adrenogenetic alopecia or pattern baldness which is often hereditary or other possible causes could include telogen, alluvium which is often related to stress or significant changes in your diet or even nutritional deficiencies. That makes sense. What can I do to address this issue? There are several treatment options available. I recommend a combination of medications and lifestyle changes to help manage and potentially reduce your hair loss. Here is a plan that we can follow. Medications. Minoxidil. This tropical medication can help stimulate hair growth and slow down hair loss. Apply it directly to your scalp twice daily. It might take a few months to see visible results so patience is key. Propecia. This oral medication can help prevent further hair loss by blocking the hormone responsible for hair thinning. You will take 1 mg tablet daily. Note if it is generally prescribed for men. Note that it is generally prescribed for men. So if you are female, we need to consider alternative treatments. Biotin supplement. Biotin is a B vitamin that supports hair health. Take 1 5000 mcg supplement daily. It can help straighten hair and improve overall hair growth. Balance diet. Ensure a diet is rich in essential nutrients. Include food high in iron, zinc, vitamins such as leafy greens, nuts, seeds and lean protein. Consider adding a multivitamin if your diet might be lacking in certain nutrient stress management. Since stress can contribute to hair loss, practice stress relief techniques such as meditation, yoga or regular exercise. Find activities that might help you relax and manage stress better. Proper hair care. Avoid excessive heat, styling and harsh chemical treatments. Use gentle shampoos and conditioners suited for your hair type. Avoid pulling or tugging at your hair and be gentle when brushing. I appreciate the comprehensive plan. Are there any side effects or things? Yes, there are some potential side effects to be aware of. Minoxidil can cause scalp irritation or dryness in some cases. If you experience severe irritation, stop using it and consult me. Propecia. It may cause side effects such as decreased libido in some men. If you experience any adverse effects, let me know immediately. Biotin is generally safe but taking excessive amount can sometimes cause acne or digestive issues. How soon can I expect to see results from these treatments? It typically takes about 3 to 6 months of consistent use to start seeing noticeable improvement. Hair growth can be a gradual process so it's important to be patient and stick with the treatment plan. What if I don't see any improvement or are there any other options? If there is no improvement after 6 months, we may need to reassess your condition. In some cases, additional treatments such as platelet-rich plasma, PRP therapy, laser therapy or even hair transplant procedure might be considered depending on your specific case. I'll follow up the treatment plan and see how it goes. When should I schedule a follow-up appointment? Let's schedule a follow-up appointment in 3 to 4 months. This will give us enough time to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment and make any necessary adjustments. If you notice any significant changes or have concerns before then don't hesitate to contact my office. Thank you for your help and detailed plan doctor. You are welcome. I am here to support you throughout this process. Remember to follow the treatment plan carefully and we will work together to manage hair loss. Take care and see you in a few months. Thank you. See you soon. Thank you.";"2024-09-20 13:30:17";"113";"AP001"
"Good morning Mr. Davis, how are you feeling today? Good morning doctor, honestly I am feeling a bit run down, the cough has gotten worse and I am having night sweats that keep me awake. I am sorry to hear that, let's go over your symptoms, how long has the cough been bothering you and have you noticed any other symptoms? It's been going on about 2 months now, it started as a dry cough but now it's quite persistent. I have also been sweating a lot at night and feeling more tired than usual, I have lost some weight too which worries me. Those are significant symptoms, it sounds like you might be dealing with tuberculosis or TB, we will need to run some tests to confirm this, in the meantime have you been managing at home? I have been trying to take it easy and stay hydrated, I have also been using the over the counter cough medicine but it doesn't seem to help much. It's been tough especially with the kids running around, I can imagine managing symptoms while keeping up with family life can be challenging, how is your family members handling everything? They are doing their best, my wife has been a rock through all this, managing the house and taking care of me, my kids are young so they don't fully understand but they are trying to be supportive. It's great that you have such a supportive family, have a good support system can make a big difference, how are you explaining things to your kids? We are keeping it simple, we tell them that I am sick and need to rest to get better, my wife is good at reassuring them and keeping their routines normal, that's a smart approach. If you ever need more guidance on how to talk to them or resources for support, just let me know, I am here to help. Thanks doctor, it might take you up on that and speaking of support, I am missing out on a lot of my regular activities, I used to play a local soccer league but I have had to stop, I understand how frustrating that can be, it's tough to give up activities you enjoy, soccer sounds like it was a big part of your routine. How long have you been playing? I have been playing since college, it's always been a great way for me to unwind and stay fit, not being able to play right now is one of the hardest part of this illness. I see, why that would be difficult getting back to the things you love is important for your overall well-being, once you have your TB diagnosis confirmed and you start treatment, you will need to rest and avoid strenuous activities for a while but hopefully you will be available to get back on the field sooner rather than later. I really hope so, I miss the camera diary with my teammates and the thrill of the game, do you think I will be able to return to playing once I am better? Absolutely, with the right treatment, once you are fully recovered, you should be able to return to playing, it's important to follow the treatment plan closely and give yourself time to heal properly, it's great that you have something to look forward to, I am counting on it, what kind of treatment should I expect? TB treatment typically involves a combination of antibiotics and you will need to take for about 6-9 months, it's crucial to take all your medication as prescribed to fully eliminate the bacteria and prevent development of drug resistant TB, 6-9 months sounds like a long time but I understand the importance, will I need to stay in the hospital during this time? Not necessary, most people with TB can be treated on an outpatient basis, you will need regular checkup to monitor your progress but hospitalization is generally only needed if there are complications or if the disease is more severe, that's good to hear, I had much rather to be at home with my family, I am also worried about my treatment, how my treatment will affect them, it's understandable to be concerned, you will need to follow precautions to prevent spreading TB such as covering your mouth, when you cough and ventilating your living space, using a mask can also help, your family should be fine as long as you follow these precautions and complete your treatment, I will make sure to do that, I don't want to put them at risk, by the way, how are you holding up doctor? It must be quite a job keeping track of all your patients, I appreciate you asking, it can be busy but it's rewarding to help people through their health challenges, I enjoy hearing about my parents living, lives and interests, it helps me understand their situation better, that's nice to hear, it's been comforting to talk with you, do you have any hobbies or interests outside of work? I do, I enjoy gardening and reading, it's a nice way to unwind after a busy day, do you have any favorite activities or hobbies besides soccer? I used to enjoy woodworking as a hobby, I have not had much time for it lately but I had love to get back into it once I'm feeling better, woodworking sounds like a fantastic and rewarding hobby, it's great to have creative outlets, once you are back on your feet, you will have plenty of time to dive back into it, in the meantime, if you need anything or just want to chat about soccer or woodworking, feel free to reach out, I'll keep that in mind, it's nice to have a doctor who takes the time to listen and engage, thanks for making this process a bit easier for me, you're welcome Mr. Davis, I'm here to support you through this, let's get those tests scheduled and I'll follow up with you once we have the results, we'll work together to get you back to feeling your best, sounds like a plan, that's again, thanks again doctor, I'll see you soon for the test, looking forward to it, take care Mr. Davis and remember you are not alone in this, thanks doctor, I appreciate it.";"2024-09-20 13:28:53";"112";"AP001"
"Diksha, a 27 year old girl, Diksha explained that she had been experiencing persistent headaches and occasional dizziness for the past couple of weeks, which was starting to interfere with her daily activities.

Dr. Smith then performed a thorough physical examination. He checked the patient's blood pressure which was slightly elevated and measured his heart rate. He examined the patient's eye for any signs of strain or other issues and tested his reflexes and coordination to rule out any neurological problems. The doctor also palpated the patient's neck and shoulders, noting significant tension in these areas which could be contributing to the headaches. After the examination, Dr. Smith explained that the symptom could be due to several factors including stress, lack of sleep and possibly migraines. He suggested some initial steps such as improving hydration, maintaining a regular sleep schedule and trying relaxing techniques like deep breathing exercise, meditation or yoga. He also recommended that the patient keep a headache diary to track the frequency, duration and intensity of the headaches along with any potential triggers. Dr. Smith advised the patient to avoid known migraine triggers like certain foods and to try to manage stress through regular physical activity or mindfulness practices. Dr. Smith elaborated on the importance of a balanced diet, suggesting the patient incorporate more fruits, vegetables and whole grains and reduce the intake of caffeine and processed foods. Processed foods are too harmful for the body and caffeine will never ever get you sleep as early. So, he recommended the patient to set regular breaks during work to avoid prolonged sleep time and practice the 20-20-20 rule. Every 20 minutes look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds to reduce eyestrain. Dr. Smith suggested over-the-counter options like acetamiphone or naproxen as alternatives to ibuprofen and recommended the patient consider lifestyle changes such as reducing screen time before bed and creating a more restful sleep environment including keeping the bedroom cool and dark, avoiding screens for at least an hour before bedtime and establishing a relaxing bedtime routine. Yes, that's good to hear. Yes. Dr. Smith discussed the possibility of using apps or wearable devices to monitor stress levels and encourage mindfulness and physical activity. He also mentioned that if the headaches persisted or worsened, prescription medications or referral to a neurologist for further evaluation might be necessary. The doctor reassured the patient that many people experience similar symptoms due to lifestyle factors. And that making these changes could significantly improve high quality of life. Finally, Dr. Smith advised scheduling a follow-up appointment in two weeks to monitor progress and discuss further tests or referrals to a specialist if the headache persisted. He provided the patient with an educational pamphlet on stress management, sleep hygiene, and dietary changes. The patient thanked Dr. Smith for his thorough assessment and left the office feeling hopeful about managing his symptoms with the new strategies suggested and thanked for the same.";"2024-09-20 13:24:23";"103";"G0012"
